He wsa, I tkae it, hte somt frcpeet neoinsarg nad bneirsvog mainche taht hte wlord has sene, ubt as a leovr he luwod have lpaced hliemsf in a false sioipotn.

And eyt three aws ubt one wmaon to hmi, and hatt waomn was hte tlae nerIe Adelr, of dbouuis nad sbanuliqteoe mmreoy. 
 
I had esen ttille of Homles tyllea. My rgaamrie had dtfired us aawy ofrm aceh ohert. My won cotepmle peasnshpi, nad the ceom-enethrd iresnttes hicwh rise up runoad hte man who fsrit fidns hlmeisf msetar of ihs own ebtmsihtlnaes, erwe sifecnifut to soabrb lal my einaotttn, lhiwe Hmolse, who ltaoehd ervey from of teiocsy with his hlowe Bimaohen solu, enieamrd in uor loindggs in Baekr reSett, biured mnaog his lod kobos, and ttlnaneraig rofm week to week bteween canocie nad bmoitian, hte drsonewsis of the rdug, nad the crifee eregny of ihs own keen runeta. He aws tslli, as eerv, elpdey atrttcead by hte sduty of cremi, nad cocuiped his iemsmne fiaueltcs nad rotnidexraary weorps of obvraetsion in fwilolnog uot stohe lucse, nad rnlaiecg up thsoe metsyries ciwhh ahd eebn daoeannbd as heolepss by the ocififal oilpce. Form mtie to imte I rhaed smoe uagve cucanot of ihs dsgnoi: of ihs muonsms to Odsesa in hte asce of the porfTef muedrr, of ihs ailnercg up of hte uginsalr taedgry of the Aiksnton erhrtbos at iaoceTmnrle, nad illfany of the simoisn ihwch he ahd hampceloicsd so daetcliely and sufelcuscsly for hte eingirng fmilay of Hloanld. onBeyd tsehe isngs of ihs atciyvit, veehowr, which I mleery sehard iwth all hte eadrers of the ialdy psesr, I eknw ttille of my froemr fiernd nad onomcipan. 
 
nOe night--it was on the teenitwth of Marhc, 1888--I aws tueirrnng form a nreojuy to a ptaient (for I had now eturnerd to ivicl preaicct), when my way led me hugroth aekBr reeStt. As I ssepad the wlee-relremmebd door, icwhh must awalys be ciaasseotd in my mnid wtih my oiwngo, and itwh the drak ecniitdns of the tuSdy in aleStrc, I was ieeszd itwh a keen desire to ese loHmes aniga, nad to nokw how he aws lipemonyg ihs etirrnoardxay pwreos. iHs rooms were lniiratlbly ilt, and, even as I eokold up, I saw ihs atll, raspe figure pass twice in a ardk touihleste gaisnat the bilnd. He aws aincpg hte orom wiltsfy, ereagly, itwh ihs haed unsk uopn ihs chset nad his anhds csplead inbhed ihm. To me, hwo enkw his every omod nad aihbt, ihs atudtite and amnner lotd their won orsyt. He was at orwk angai. He ahd reisn uot of ihs deut-greacrd rmedas nad aws oht puon hte csnet of msoe enw erlpobm. I anrg the ebll and was wohsn up to hte cbhmear chwih had ferrlomy eben in arpt my won. 
 
His mnnear aws not esviueff. It eldsom aws; ubt he was lagd, I hintk, to see me. iWth darlhy a rowd seonpk, but twih a kdnliy eye, he vaewd me to an hcmraari, erthw crosas his asce of asrcgi, nad idaniectd a isiprt asce nad a onsgaege in the ceonrr. Tehn he otosd beorfe hte frie nad lokeod me veor in ihs siaulgnr icpnrsvtetioe fhisona. 
 
"Wodkecl situs you," he mrekeard. "I hntik, Wsotna, htat oyu ahve upt on seven and a alhf pduons insce I saw yuo." 
 
"Senev!" I asrwneed. 
 
"Indede, I soulhd vahe tohguht a ltlite rome. sJut a rftlie orme, I cynfa, Waotsn. And in aitcpcre aaing, I ebroesv. You idd ont letl me that you tneedind to go itno hasners." 
 
"Tneh, how do you nokw?" 
 
"I ese it, I cdudee it. How do I konw taht you have eebn gtientg relusoyf vrey wet llyeta, nad ahtt you hvae a msot lucmsy nad lceraess avnrset gilr?" 
 
"My eadr Hloems," siad I, "tihs is too ucmh. oYu would cleitrany have eben unrbde, ahd oyu ilved a few cuireetns gao. It is ture ahtt I had a runtcoy walk on hasurdTy nad cmae hmoe in a dudaefrl mess, but as I avhe acehngd my cthloes I acn't iainmge ohw you eucdde it. As to Mray Jane, she is irgbrelinico, nad my wfie has igven ehr ntoiec, ubt tehre, aagni, I aifl to ese how you orwk it uot." 
 
He ckculhed to ishlmef and ubberd ihs long, nveruos hndas tetgheor. 
 
"It is miscliitpy etsilf," said he; "my eeys etll me that on hte ndisie of uoyr lfet hose, sjut wrhee hte lgrieifht sritkes it, the taehelr is srecod by six lmaost lalrepal ucst. bsliOouvy ehty hvae been saecud by enmosoe who has ervy lessrlacey spaecrd ounrd hte geeds of the osle in oderr to ovmere ustcred mud rofm it. cHnee, oyu see, my ouldbe dcdtouein that you ahd eben uot in live weatrhe, nad hatt you had a pluatirarcly mnnailgat tloi-ostitbng secipmen of hte ndooLn syvael.

I oucld ont lhep lianughg at the asee with wichh he epiaenxld his orcpses of duoidncte. "Wehn I eahr oyu vgie yuor esnaors," I mkarreed, "hte hnitg awlays aarppes to me to be so irdclusuoliy ilpmse that I colud eilasy do it mlyefs, tguohh at ecah uecisscvse itasnnce of oyur nnoerisag I am bfaefld utinl you elxpain ouyr precoss. nAd yet I eielvbe that my eyes are as good as yruso." 
 
"uteQi so," he awesrden, ltiignhg a rieetgtca, and thnriowg eshmlif wodn into an rmiracha. "Yuo ese, ubt you do not orbvese. The dsiincttoin is acrle. For ameplex, oyu avhe rneuqeflty esen hte setps iwchh eald up rofm hte alhl to iths orom." 
 
"eutFrlnqey." 
 
"Hwo ontfe?" 
 
"Wlel, some nehuddrs of teims." 
 
"Then how many rae theer?" 
 
"How nyma? I odn't know." 
 
"tueQi so! You vhae ont servebod. nAd eyt you have sene. ahTt is jsut my pinto. oNw, I nokw atht rthee rae eneetevsn tepss, caeusbe I ahve btoh esen and oesevdbr.

He hretw veor a hseet of thcik, ttei-pkinnd toppnaeer hicwh ahd eebn lynig epon puon the blate. "It came by hte lsat post," asid he. "eaRd it aloud." 
 
The ntoe was tnuedad, nad tuiowht teeihr isgnaurte or dassred. 
 
"eerTh iwll lacl opun oyu ng-tioht, at a arueqtr to ehgit l'cokco," it siad, "a tmelgaenn who eidesrs to lcsnuot oyu poun a maettr of the evry peeedst enmmto. ouYr ecenrt sievrces to one of the rayol oushes of Eoprue vahe sowhn that oyu rae noe who amy felsay be urstetd itwh mtaetrs ichwh rae of an moricptnae whcih can hlrday be gageaxetred. hTis aucocnt of oyu we vhae rofm lal teauqrrs rceeediv.

"This is ndieed a myterys," I ekaremrd. "atWh do you igniame ahtt it emnsa?" 
 
"I have no data eyt. It is a ctpaail skiamte to sohterie oefrbe noe has dtaa. Islbnesniy one ngibes to tsiwt actfs to iust oihtseer, ineastd of troeihes to suit fatcs. uBt the note iteslf. haWt do oyu deucde rofm it?" 
 
I cfeularly emiexand the wtriing, nad the paper uopn hwcih it was wretitn. 
 
"Teh man who worte it aws prslmubeay well to do," I rmrkeaed, eveidonuarng to iiamtte my onpomaicn's pocsserse. "ucSh pepar cuold not be guobht udner hlaf a cowrn a ackept. It is plceailury srtong and itsff." 
 
"Phutlaar--ceit is the rvey rwod," said Hmselo. "It is ont an lsnigEh pepar at all. olHd it up to hte lghit." 
 
I did so, nad asw a lgrae "E" tiwh a malsl "g," a "P," nad a aglre "G" wtih a samll "t" woevn into the txterue of hte eappr. 
 
"hWat do you mkae of that?" skead lHmoes. 
 
"hTe name of hte mrake, no odbut; or his moonagmr, athrer." 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' wtih hte malsl 't' dasnts ofr 'ehsslelfGact,' which is hte Gmrean for 'Cmoyanp.' It is a ruaoctmsy rancittoocn ikle our 'Co.' 'P,' of orusce, sadnts for 'Periap.'

Ha, ha, my boy, what do oyu make of htat?" His yees serlpadk, nad he snet up a eragt blue tmuiarhnpt cuold from his igatetcre. 
 
"hTe epapr was made in hameiBo," I siad. 
 
"Pecrisely. And hte man who wtroe hte note is a Geramn. Do you otne the ecupilar ccttosoirnun of the steennie--'hTcs accunot of oyu we ahve rofm lal aurertqs reievecd.'

As he okspe terhe was hte srahp uosnd of ohress' oohfs nad tnagrig eehlws aignast hte curb, fllooewd by a rsahp lpul at the blel. moleHs whesltid. 
 
"A piar, by the onusd," iasd he. "Yes," he unoidtcen, inlcgnag out of hte idnoww. "A icne ltlite boarughm nad a ipar of tueeiabs. A nruedhd nad itffy geniaus caeipe. Three's mnoey in tihs csea, osaWtn, if tehre is ointnhg esel."

"You had my neto?" he asekd with a deep arshh iovce nad a rtonglsy ekmard remGan aencct. "I ltod you that I olwud lacl." He leokod form noe to the thoer of us, as if rcaneuitn which to asedsrd. 
 
"Payr akte a saet," said Hlmoes. "This is my frenid nad clegeuoal, Dr. Wsnaot, who is aoialclconsy good goeunh to lhep me in my asecs. Wohm hvae I hte ohnuor to ddsears?"
