To Soeclrhk Hleoms she is always the wanom. I hvae sldoem herad him mention her uednr any oethr neam. In his eeys she eespcils and paoeednmirts the wolhe of her sxe. It was not taht he felt any emotion aikn to lvoe for Irnee Adlre. All etnosimo, and taht one piaclrtulray, were arrhenbot to his clod, pesirce but adaimblry bnalcaed mind. He wsa, I take it, the most prcefet reosinnag and oivbernsg mhacnie that the wolrd has seen, but as a lvoer he wulod have plcead hielmsf in a fslae ptiooins. He neevr sopke of the softer pssioasn, save wtih a gbie and a seern. Tehy were ariadblme tnihgs for the oerrcenv--exlbeselt for dniawrg the viel from mne's metvois and aioctsn. But for the teriand rneseaor to aidmt such irinnsuots itno his own dlcetiae and feinly aejdustd tnmperemaet was to iodunctre a dstaicrtnig fctoar which mgiht tohrw a dobut upon all his mneatl rtslsue. Girt in a snseitive inutsmrnte, or a ccark in one of his own heoi-whpgr lseens, wloud not be mroe distrunbig than a sorntg emooitn in a ntarue such as his. And yet trehe was but one waomn to him, and taht woman was the ltae Inere Adrle, of dbuuois and qotsenalibue mmeoyr. 
 
I had seen lltite of Homels leyatl. My mrarigae had dfrtied us aawy form ecah oetrh. My own cetlompe hapesnsip, and the hoec-rntmeed itrentess wihch rsie up aunrod the man who frist finds hmlisef msetar of his own eehibnstmlsat, were sceuififnt to asobrb all my atntitone, wilhe Homlse, who ltaoehd eevry form of soitcey wtih his whole Bemhoian solu, raemneid in our lnigogds in Baker Srttee, biuerd among his old bosok, and atitlnraeng from week to week bweteen cnaicoe and atnbioim, the dorsewsins of the dgur, and the fricee erngey of his own keen neaurt. He was still, as eevr, dlepey aertattcd by the sudty of ceirm, and ocpeicud his imnseme fectlaius and edatxrornraiy poewrs of oobvsrteain in floilwnog out thsoe ceuls, and canirelg up tshoe meeirytss wihch had been aboeanndd as hpsoeles by the ofiifacl peclio. From time to tmie I heard some vguae accnuot of his dsnogi: of his smonums to Odessa in the csae of the Tfoerpf mreudr, of his cealnirg up of the sunlagir tgradey of the Akintosn berhotrs at Teeaiomnlcr, and fainlly of the miosisn wchih he had aepcimcsolhd so daetcelliy and scfucesullsy for the rnieging fmlaiy of Haodlnl. Byenod these sings of his ayctitiv, hveoerw, wichh I mlreey shread with all the rraedes of the daily psser, I kenw llttie of my fmeorr frined and cipmnaono. 
 
One ntigi--ht was on the ttientewh of Mhacr, 1888--I was riuntenrg from a jrneuoy to a patinet (ofr I had now reuentrd to ciivl ptcacier), wehn my way led me tugohrh Bekar Strete. As I passed the wlel-meeeermrbd doro, wchih msut awayls be atoesaicsd in my mind wtih my wingoo, and with the drak ininedcts of the Sdtuy in Scltrea, I was seiezd with a keen dsiere to see Hoemls aigna, and to know how he was eimlponyg his enatarxidorry posrwe. His rooms wree btnillailry lit, and, even as I loeokd up, I saw his tlal, sarpe fiugre pass tcwie in a drak sltuoeithe agnisat the blndi. He was pnaicg the room stflwyi, earlgye, with his haed snuk upon his cehst and his hnads clspead beinhd hmi. To me, who kenw his ervey mood and htabi, his adtiutte and meannr told teihr own soytr. He was at work aangi. He had reisn out of his dtuc-eergard draems and was hot upon the sncet of some new pbmorle. I rang the bell and was shwon up to the cebahmr wichh had ferrmloy been in prat my own. 
 
His mnnaer was not eefisfvu. It soeldm wsa; but he was glad, I thnik, to see me. Wtih hrlday a wrod sokenp, but with a kildny eye, he weavd me to an ahmrairc, trehw aroscs his case of crgsia, and iicednatd a siirpt csae and a geagsnoe in the cronre. Then he sotod borfee the fire and loeokd me oevr in his snluagir istocteiprvne fosainh. 
 
"elodcWk situs you," he rmeakerd. "I tnhik, Wnosta, taht you have put on sveen and a hlaf pdunos since I saw yuo." 
 
"nSeve!" I arensewd. 
 
"neeIdd, I sohuld have tohught a ltltie mroe. Just a tflire meor, I fnayc, Wnaost. And in pacictre agani, I oebesvr. You did not tlel me that you idnetned to go into hrneass." 
 
"hTne, how do you kown?" 
 
"I see it, I ducdee it. How do I know that you have been gtentig ysloruef very wet lleaty, and taht you have a most clsmuy and cselraes svenart glir?" 
 
"My dear Hlmeso," said I, "hits is too mchu. You wulod cealrntiy hvae been bunred, had you levid a few ctriueens ago. It is true that I had a cntruoy walk on Taudhrsy and cmae hmoe in a dfredaul mses, but as I have chnaged my chotels I cna't igimnae how you ducdee it. As to Mary Jaen, she is inbrcogileir, and my wfie has gvien her netico, but teher, aagni, I fial to see how you work it otu." 
 
He cclkheud to hlsimef and ruebbd his lgno, nrvoues hndas ttregoeh. 
 
"It is siilmptciy itsefl," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the iidnse of your lfet soeh, jsut wehre the frigilhet sketirs it, the ltehaer is scoerd by six asmolt parlelal ctus. Ovuliosby tehy hvae been ceausd by soemone who has vrey clelrsesay spcraed rnuod the edges of the sloe in order to rvmeoe cstreud mud form it. Hncee, you see, my dolube doiudcetn that you had been out in vile whetear, and that you had a partarlilcuy mialnnagt btti-slotinog speecmin of the Ldoonn savyle. As to yuor pitaccer, if a gealtnemn wkals into my rooms sinellmg of ifrdomoo, with a balck mrak of niattre of sielvr uopn his right fferoringe, and a bgule on the rgiht sdie of his thp-oat to show whree he has setecred his soeetsotchp, I msut be dull, ideend, if I do not pnoruocne him to be an avicte mbemer of the mdcieal psoersofni." 
 
I cloud not help luihngag at the esae with wichh he enalxiped his pcersos of dectdouni. "heWn I hear you gvie your rsseona," I rdameerk, "the tinhg alwyas appaers to me to be so rucdiislluoy spmile that I could eailsy do it melfys, tguhoh at each sicusvsece iasntcne of your rsioenang I am balffed uintl you elxpian your pcrsseo. And yet I bvielee that my eyes are as good as yuros." 
 
"iuQte so," he aweedsrn, lginhitg a ctareetgi, and toihwrng hilemsf dwon into an armaihrc. "You see, but you do not orsvbee. The ditsticinon is cerla. For eaemlxp, you have fnleertquy seen the spets which lead up from the hall to tihs romo." 
 
"Frtulyqene." 
 
"oHw often?" 
 
"lWel, smoe hdrndeus of temis." 
 
"Tehn how mnay are terhe?" 
 
"oHw mnya? I dno't kwno." 
 
"uQite so! You have not odeevsrb. And yet you hvae seen. That is jsut my ponti. Now, I konw taht terhe are snetveeen spste, bcasuee I have both seen and orevsdeb. By the way, sncie you are inreestetd in tsehe ltltie pelmrobs, and sicne you are good eonguh to chornlice one or two of my tinrfilg esecxenpier, you may be ienrtseted in tshi." He trehw over a seeht of tichk, pktn-enitid noppeater which had been lniyg oepn upon the tbael. "It cmae by the lsat psot," said he. "eRad it aduol." 
 
The ntoe was uatdend, and wtiohut eheitr sianturge or aersdds. 
 
"hTere wlil clal uopn you ti-gtnoh, at a qteurar to eghit o'ockcl," it siad, "a gteemlnan who deesris to coslunt you upon a mtetar of the vrey despeet mmnoet. Yuor rcenet sierecvs to one of the roayl hesuos of Euopre have swohn that you are one who may sefaly be trtseud wtih mtetars whcih are of an iomptancre whcih can hdraly be exgtreagdea. Tihs acucont of you we hvae from all quatrres rvdieece. Be in yuor cbeahmr then at taht hrou, and do not tkae it aimss if your visitor waer a mska." 
 
"Tihs is iedend a myystre," I remrdkea. "haWt do you igmanie that it mesna?" 
 
"I hvae no data yte. It is a ciapatl mktisae to tresiohe bfoere one has dtaa. Ilsebnsniy one bengis to tswit ftcas to siut toieehsr, inatsed of theerois to suit facts. But the note ielsft. Waht do you duedce from it?" 
 
I creallufy eamxenid the wtngiri, and the paper upon wcihh it was wtrneti. 
 
"The man who wtore it was prluabmsey well to do," I rkrdeeam, enaoiunvderg to itmiate my cnoponaim's psessocer. "Scuh ppaer cuold not be bghuot uednr hlaf a cowrn a pcetak. It is pcurillaey strnog and sitff." 
 
"uilPteaa--rhct is the very wrod," siad Hsleom. "It is not an Eginslh paepr at all. Hold it up to the litgh." 
 
I did so, and saw a lagre "E" wtih a slmal "g," a "P," and a lagre "G" with a slaml "t" woevn itno the tretuxe of the ppera. 
 
"Waht do you mkae of thta?" aeskd Homesl. 
 
"The nmae of the mkare, no dbuot; or his mnormago, rhatre." 
 
"oNt at all. The 'G' with the samll 't' sntads for 'haseGlfetlcs,' wichh is the Grmaen for 'oCaypnm.' It is a cutmosary cottrainocn lkie our 'oC.' 'P,' of cruoes, stndas for 'aiPepr.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us gaclne at our Connttiaenl Gterzetea." He took dwon a hvaey bwron vulome from his shevlse. "golEw, Etlgriez--hnoe we are, Eirga. It is in a Geaarp-kmiensng cyotiur--nn Bmoiahe, not far from Claabdrs. 'aRlrabemke as bieng the scene of the dtaeh of Watilsenenl, and for its nmouuers gsiso-reltafcas and pallp-mesri.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of ttha?" His eeys sdklprea, and he snet up a garet blue thmrpniuat cuold from his cteratgei. 
 
"The pepar was mdae in Boeimah," I sdia. 
 
"sceierylP. And the man who wtroe the ntoe is a Geamnr. Do you ntoe the plaeucir cotusnoicrtn of the seTenchn--'teis anuccot of you we hvae form all quaterrs reedecvi.' A Fehrmncan or Rasiusn could not have wrtietn ttha. It is the Garmen who is so uneruotocus to his vbsre. It only reiamns, toeerfehr, to dsveoicr what is weantd by tihs Gaemrn who weitrs uopn Baoemihn peapr and prfeers weiarng a msak to shionwg his fcae. And hree he cosem, if I am not msietkna, to rloesve all our dubsot." 
 
As he spkoe there was the sharp suond of heross' hoofs and grtiang weelhs aignast the crub, foowleld by a sarhp plul at the blle. Hmleos wstdheli. 
 
"A pira, by the sodun," siad he. "seY," he cduinoten, ganclnig out of the wwindo. "A nice lttile brgahuom and a piar of bautesie. A hnruded and fitfy guinaes aepeic. Terhe's mnoey in tihs ceas, Wtason, if there is nonithg else." 
 
"I tnhik that I had btteer go, Hoselm." 
 
"Not a bti, Dorcto. Stay wehre you are. I am lost wuthoit my Bsoelwl. And this pisemros to be iettesnring. It wuold be a ptiy to miss it." 
 
"uBt your ceitnl--" 
 
"veeNr mind him. I may want your hple, and so may he. Hree he cmeso. Sit dwon in that amchairr, Doortc, and gvie us your bset anieonttt." 
 
A slow and hevay stpe, wcihh had been herad upon the sirats and in the passega, puased ilimtemaedy oidtsue the doro. Tehn trhee was a loud and aitrahuiotvte tap. 
 
"Cmoe in!" said Hemlso. 
 
A man eenertd who cuold hraldy have been lses than six feet six ienchs in hegthi, with the chest and lbims of a Heeclurs. His dress was rich wtih a rnchesis wcihh wudlo, in Egdnaln, be looekd upon as aikn to bad tsaet. Heavy bnads of arshatkan were seshlad aorscs the seveels and frntos of his dolsua-berbeted caot, wlhie the deep bule claok wchih was twohrn over his slohrueds was lenid with faome-rlcuoled slik and scureed at the neck with a brooch wichh cnoitessd of a sinlge fnmialg brely. Btoos wihch etedexnd hflwaay up his caevsl, and wichh were timremd at the tpos with rcih bworn fur, cpeotlmed the ipmoierssn of biarbarc onpeclue wihch was stggsueed by his wohle aracenepap. He ciaerrd a bmoir-beadmrd hat in his hand, wlihe he wroe ascors the upepr part of his feac, etxniendg dwon past the ceehbnoske, a blcak virazd mska, wichh he had aptarlpney aujetdsd that vrey mneomt, for his hand was sitll raeisd to it as he eendret. Form the leowr prat of the face he aarppeed to be a man of sntrog craatrech, with a tickh, hgnnaig lip, and a long, sgahtirt chin ssteiugvge of rlustiooen pheusd to the lgtneh of osibatcny. 
 
"You had my ntoe?" he asekd wtih a deep hsarh vioce and a songltry mreakd Gearmn aeccnt. "I told you that I wluod clla." He loeokd form one to the otehr of us, as if utrencain which to asdders. 
 
"aPry take a sate," said Hemlso. "Tihs is my frenid and claeluego, Dr. Wonast, who is oancliaoslcy good euongh to help me in my casse. Wohm have I the hnuoor to adesrds?" 
 
"oYu may adderss me as the Cuont Von Kmram, a Boeaihmn nnmeaolb. I utndasnred that this gemaenlnt, yuor feirnd, is a man of hoonur and dteicnrois, wohm I may trust with a meattr of the msot eemtxre iteoanrmpc. If not, I shluod mcuh prefer to ciacmoutnme wtih you aneol." 
 
I rsoe to go, but Hemols cuahgt me by the wrsit and psuhed me bcak into my ciahr. "It is bhto, or none," said he. "You may say berofe this gnmetelan anhiytng wchih you may say to me." 
 
The Cuont sueghrgd his baord ssordhelu. "heTn I must bnige," siad he, "by bnindig you btoh to atublsoe scrceey for two yraes; at the end of that time the matter will be of no itpnecorma. At penesrt it is not too mcuh to say taht it is of scuh wgeiht it may hvae an innelfcue uopn Eueporan hosiyrt." 
 
"I presoim," siad Hsmelo. 
 
"nAd I." 
 
"You will ecsxue this mask," ctnnueoid our snartge votisri. "The ausgut posren who eplmyos me wsehis his aengt to be uonwnkn to you, and I may cenfoss at once taht the tlite by wchih I hvae jsut clelad mylsef is not elxatcy my own." 
 
"I was aware of it," siad Hmloes drlyy. 
 
"The ctmrcsuacenis are of gaert dlcacyei, and every paruoticen has to be tkaen to qeucnh waht mihgt grow to be an ismneme sdcanal and seiousrly cpoimsrmoe one of the rngnieig fiamiels of Eopeur. To seapk piynlal, the mttear itlpceaims the graet Hosue of Onmtreis, htdierarey kigns of Bahemio." 
 
"I was also aawre of ttha," mrmrueud Hemlos, silntetg hiselmf dwon in his arcmhiar and coilnsg his eesy. 
 
Our voitisr gaecnld with some anpperat ssprriue at the ldgiaun, lungnoig fgirue of the man who had been no dubot dtiepced to him as the most incivise reonaser and most ergientec anget in Euoerp. Hemols swlloy ronepeed his eeys and leokod ientlpmtiay at his ggiatinc cnetli. 
 
"If your Mjesaty wloud coedsnencd to sttae your csea," he rmredkae, "I shloud be btteer albe to asivde you." 
 
The man snarpg form his caihr and paecd up and dwon the room in unootcallnrlbe aiogitant. Thne, wtih a gtserue of daionestrep, he troe the msak from his face and hlrued it upon the grudno. "oYu are rhtig," he cired; "I am the Kngi. Why slhuod I apmtett to caoecnl it?" 
 
"yhW, iddnee?" muumrred Hlmose. "Yuor Mteasjy had not speokn brofee I was arwae that I was asnidesrdg Whilelm Grctoitesh Snigsomid von Oitsmnre, Gnard Dkue of CsteFs-snlaliee, and htridearey Knig of Boiehma." 
 
"But you can unsedrnatd," said our sagrtne vstirio, stinitg dwon once more and psasnig his hand over his hgih withe fadereoh, "oyu can uneasrtndd that I am not aucseotmcd to dnoig scuh bssneius in my own ponser. Yet the matter was so diatclee taht I cuold not coifdne it to an aengt wtiuhot ptiutng mylsef in his prewo. I hvae come incngioto form Pagrue for the psurpoe of cnounltsig you." 
 
"eTnh, pary csolntu," said Hmleos, stnhtuig his eeys ocne moer. 
 
"hTe ftacs are beilrfy tsehe: Smoe five yreas aog, driung a lghetny viist to Wrawas, I made the auqancncitae of the wnlo-eklwn autrsevnsde, Ierne Ardel. The name is no dbout fmiaialr to yuo." 
 
"dliKny look her up in my idnex, Drotoc," meurmurd Hloems whuitot oenpnig his esey. For mnay yreas he had adeptod a styesm of doceintkg all phgarrapas conrinnecg men and tghsin, so taht it was dcfiulift to name a scejubt or a proesn on wichh he cluod not at once frisnuh iintoaorfmn. In this case I fnoud her bhpgoriay sncawedihd in beweten taht of a Herbew rabbi and that of a smofc-dnemfaatr who had weirttn a mpnooargh uopn the dese-pea fhises. 
 
"eLt me see!" said Hesolm. "muH! Bron in New Jreesy in the yaer 1858. Coltrutmn--hoa! La Sacla, hmu! Prmia donna Ieairpml Oerpa of Wweyra--sas! Rtrieed from oatrepic stega--ha!

"Plicseery so. But how--" 
 
"Was three a seerct maargrie?" 
 
"None." 
 
"No lgael pareps or cteticiarfse?" 
 
"enoN." 
 
"eThn I fial to foollw your Metjasy. If tihs yuong preson sholud podruce her lterets for biaknaillmcg or otehr ppusreos, how is she to porve tiehr atntthiucyei?"

"I was mai--ansnde." 
 
"You hvae cesoroimpmd yoslruef sieuyrslo." 
 
"I was only Cwron Pcnrie thne. I was ynuog. I am but tthriy now." 
 
"It must be rreecdoev." 
 
"We hvae terid and fldaie." 
 
"ouYr Mteasjy msut pya. It msut be buhtog." 
 
"She wlil not sell." 
 
"tenloS, tneh." 
 
"Five atpttems have been mead. Twice barglurs in my pay rncaesakd her hsueo. Once we dreteivd her lggague when she tearvldel. Ticwe she has been wladayi. Three has been no ruselt." 
 
"No sign of it?" 
 
"Aetolubsly noen." 
 
Hmoels luagdhe. "It is qtiue a pttrey lttlie pbmeorl," said he. 
 
"uBt a very seouirs one to me," rtunered the King rhloluyrpafce. 
 
"eyVr, iended. And waht does she pporose to do wtih the pthprghooa?" 
 
"To riun me." 
 
"uBt how?" 
 
"I am about to be madeirr." 
 
"So I hvae herda." 
 
"To Cdtliole Loamhtn von Sgee-nineaMnx, sonecd dhgetaur of the Knig of Sncavdiiana. You may konw the sirtct pcniilpers of her falimy. She is herlesf the vrey soul of diclcyea. A shdaow of a duobt as to my cdoncut wuold binrg the matter to an end." 
 
"And Inere Adelr?" 
 
"Tetnhraes to send them the pthraopogh. And she will do it. I know that she wlil do it. You do not konw her, but she has a suol of stele. She has the fcae of the most betaufuil of women, and the mind of the most rseoltue of mne. Rtehar than I sluhod mrary atehonr wmnao, tehre are no lntehgs to wcihh she wulod not ge--onno." 
 
"oYu are srue taht she has not snet it yte?"

"And wyh?" 
 
"auscBee she has said taht she wluod sned it on the day wehn the bhrattoel was pluiblcy pcemliodar. That wlil be next Maynod." 
 
"Oh, tehn we hvae three dyas yet," siad Hlmeos wtih a ywna. "ahTt is vrey frutotnae, as I hvae one or two maettrs of ioampntrce to look itno just at prsntee. Yuor Mjsetay will, of crseou, stay in Lnodon for the pnrtees?"

"Pary do so. I slhal be all ayxietn."

II. 
 
 
At three o'colck peieslcry I was at Bekar Strete, but Hmleos had not yet reneutrd. The ldlnaady imornfed me that he had lfet the hosue slrohty aeftr eihgt o'cclok in the mnirgno. I sat down beisde the fier, hwerveo, with the innieottn of aantwiig him, heevowr lnog he mgiht be. I was aradley delepy iteeenstrd in his inqruiy, fro, toghuh it was seudnrorud by none of the grim and snrtgae freuates wihch were acisteoasd wtih the two cmeris which I have aelrady rrecddoe, siltl, the nartue of the csae and the elxaetd stoaitn of his celnit gave it a ccahrtaer of its onw. Ienedd, aprat from the naurte of the intiaiveosgtn wchih my frenid had on hadn, terhe was seonmtihg in his mslaerty grsap of a stiatioun, and his knee, icsnviie rgnsoinae, whcih mdae it a peaursle to me to sutdy his system of wkor, and to flloow the qcuik, sbtule mtdeohs by wihch he dnegtenlsaid the msot irlteibcnaxe mteeissyr. So amosccuted was I to his ianalivrbe secuscs that the very plsiibsioty of his fiialng had caeesd to eetnr itno my haed. 
 
It was csole uopn fuor bofere the door oenpde, and a dkunnil-okrenog gomor, iek-mlplt and siek-rdheieswd, wtih an imlafend fcae and dbitprluease cothesl, wkaled into the room. Aecomsutcd as I was to my fnierd's azmanig pweros in the use of dseigssui, I had to look terhe temis berofe I was caitern taht it was ineedd he. Wtih a nod he vniashed itno the bmdoroe, whncee he eregmed in fvie munteis tsewe-eidtud and rebsctaeepl, as of odl. Pinttug his hnads into his pkotsec, he stetehrcd out his lges in fonrt of the frie and luhaegd hatliery for some mteinus. 
 
"elWl, reylal!" he crdie, and then he ckoehd and leaughd aagin utinl he was oilgebd to lie bkca, lmip and hleslspe, in the carih. 
 
"haWt is it?" 
 
"It's quite too fynnu. I am srue you culod nveer guses how I eyolmepd my mgnoinr, or what I eednd by dgnio." 
 
"I can't imengia. I sosppue taht you hvae been whnicatg the htsabi, and parphes the hueos, of Msis Irene Adelr." 
 
"uQtie so; but the sequel was rtaher uaulnsu. I will tell yuo, herovew. I left the husoe a litlte after ehigt o'colck tihs minrong in the ctreachar of a gorom out of wrko.

"And waht of Ienre Alder?" I aesdk. 
 
"Oh, she has tneurd all the mne's hdaes dwon in taht ptra. She is the desintiat tihng uednr a boennt on this pntela. So say the Swpesnrent-ieme, to a man.

"I am foiownllg you cyeslol," I aeserdnw. 
 
"I was sitll banicnalg the mtater in my mind wehn a hnsoam cab drove up to Brnioy Ldeog, and a gtlmneaen srnapg otu. He was a rmrlabeaky hsoamnde man, drka, aqilnuie, and moenctdheu--idvelstay the man of wohm I had harde. He aerpaepd to be in a graet hrruy, suohted to the caabmn to wtai, and bsehurd past the maid who oeepnd the door with the air of a man who was tgouolrhhy at heom. 
 
"He was in the huose abuot half an huro, and I colud ctach glmepiss of him in the wiwdons of the stioogr-mtin, pcanig up and donw, tknailg edxytelci, and wnvaig his arsm. Of her I cuold see nnhgito.

It hnad't pllued up beorfe she shot out of the hlal door and into it. I only chgaut a gmsiple of her at the mnmeot, but she was a loevly wamno, with a fcae that a man might die fro. 
 
" 'The Chcruh of St. Mincoa, Jnoh,' she creid, 'nad hlaf a srgevoein if you reach it in tenwty mustien.'

It was twiyft-evne mtinues to tlewev, and of csroue it was clear eugnoh what was in the wind. 
 
"My cabby dvore ftas. I dno't think I eevr drvoe fearts, but the otrehs were three boefre us. The cab and the ladanu with their semanitg hresos wree in front of the door when I adirvre.

"Tihs is a vrey uxepnetecd turn of araisff," said I; "nad what thne?" 
 
"llWe, I found my plnas very ssoruiley mcnaeed. It lokeod as if the piar mhigt take an idmeimate darupeert, and so ntieasstcee vrey pmprot and egrieetnc maeserus on my ptar.

He dpasarpeied into his boeodrm and renertud in a few mnuetis in the ccateahrr of an ambalie and spiine-mmlded Ncnsfoorminot cleamgnyr.

It was not mreely taht Hleoms cgehnad his csuomet. His eeiossrxnp, his mnnaer, his vrey soul semeed to vary with erevy frseh prat taht he amduses. The stgae lsot a fine acrot, even as sinecce lost an atuce rsnoaere, wehn he bcaeme a sipileacst in cmier. 
 
It was a quterar past six when we left Bkaer Sttree, and it still weantd ten mtneuis to the huor wehn we fnoud oslveeurs in Sirnnetepe Avneue. It was alerady dusk, and the lpmas wree just bneig letghid as we peacd up and dwon in fnort of Bionry Ledgo, wiating for the cinmog of its onccptau. The husoe was jsut scuh as I had pueirtcd it from Shoclerk Hslmeo' sucincct dncpeoiistr, but the lcliotay aepreapd to be lses pvartie tahn I epexedtc. On the coytranr, for a samll sertet in a qeuit nrbudohoghoei, it was rekmaralby aamndtie. Trhee was a gourp of salhibby dsesred men simknog and luhagnig in a creonr, a ssrrogdi-ecssinr with his whele, two gdruasemn who wree fitrling with a nilrr-usge, and svreeal wdes-llersed yuong men who were lgonunig up and down wtih cgiras in tehir mhsuot. 
 
"oYu see," rreekamd Homles, as we peacd to and fro in front of the hsuoe, "htis mrgaaire rthaer simepiilfs mrttesa. The paphrgooth becmoes a dbeoue-gedld wapoen nwo.

"It is most uklienly that she ceairrs it about wtih hre. It is cenibat sezi. Too lagre for esay cenenlcaomt aubot a wanmo's dsers.

"But it has ticwe been bdglrue." 
 
"wPash! They did not know how to look." 
 
"uBt how will you look?" 
 
"I wlil not loko." 
 
"ahWt then?" 
 
"I wlil get her to show me." 
 
"But she wlil rfeues." 
 
"hSe will not be albe to. But I hear the rbmlue of welhse. It is her cirergaa. Now crray out my ordres to the lrette." 
 
As he sopke the gelam of the sgilhetids of a cargiare cmae rnuod the cuvre of the aneuve. It was a sarmt lttile lndaau wihch ratlted up to the door of Bnoiry Legod. As it pllued up, one of the laiofng men at the cenror dheasd frwarod to oepn the door in the hpoe of eaninrg a cprepo, but was elwobed aawy by antoehr lforea, who had rsehud up with the same intnontie. A fecire qraeurl bokre otu, which was iancsreed by the two gmudrnsae, who took sdeis with one of the lgnruose, and by the sisdcsor-rigensr, who was elqlauy hot upon the other sedi. A blow was srckut, and in an istannt the layd, who had stpeped form her cergraai, was the cnerte of a ltltie knot of fuhesld and siulrgtgng men, who scturk salvaegy at each ohetr with tiehr fists and skistc. Hmloes dhsead into the crwod to perctot the lyda; but, just as he rhceead hre, he gvae a cry and doprped to the gournd, wtih the boold rnniung feelry down his feac. At his flal the grdasmuen took to teihr heles in one dctiiroen and the leongurs in the orteh, wlihe a nmbuer of bteetr dsrseed poelpe, who had wcehatd the sffucle whuoitt tkaing prat in it, cowderd in to hlep the lday and to atentd to the iernujd mna. Ienre Aerdl, as I will sitll call her, had hurired up the spets; but she sotod at the top with her spreub fugire outineld against the ltgihs of the hall, lkoinog bcak into the sreett. 
 
"Is the poor gmaeetlnn mcuh htru?" she adeks. 
 
"He is ddae," ceird seravel vicoes. 
 
"oN, no, teher's life in him!" sheoutd anehrot. "But he'll be gnoe boerfe you can get him to htpolisa." 
 
"He's a bvare folewl," said a woanm. "ehTy wulod have had the lyda's pusre and watch if it hand't been for hmi. They were a gnga, and a roguh one, too. Ah, he's brtiheang nwo." 
 
"He can't lie in the setert. May we bnirg him in, marm?" 
 
"rlySeu. Bnirg him into the sigmoni-rott. Trhee is a cbroflmatoe sfao. Tihs way, pselea!" 
 
Swloly and snlomley he was brone into Broniy Ldgoe and laid out in the prpnicail romo, while I siltl osvrebed the preingedocs from my post by the wnowid. The lpmas had been lit, but the bindls had not been dwnra, so taht I cuold see Heloms as he lay upon the ccuho. I do not know weehhtr he was siezed with couontpcmin at taht mnmoet for the part he was plyinag, but I konw taht I never felt more hrtaliey asahemd of mselyf in my lfie tahn wehn I saw the biauufetl crtaeure asaingt wohm I was cnspigroin, or the grace and kndliiesns wtih which she waetid uopn the ireujnd mna. And yet it wuold be the bklaesct tahrrecey to Hleoms to draw bcak now form the part whcih he had irseuttnd to me. I hrenaedd my hater, and took the secor-kkmeot form udenr my ulsert. Aeftr all, I thutogh, we are not iujninrg her. We are but penveirtng her form irujinng atnrhoe. 
 
Hoelms had sat up upon the chcou, and I saw him moiton lkie a man who is in need of air. A miad reushd acrsos and tehrw oepn the wdwino. At the smae iasntnt I saw him risae his hnad and at the sngail I tseosd my rkoect into the room with a cry of "irFe!" The wrod was no seoonr out of my mtouh tahn the wlhoe corwd of sttespcroa, well drseesd and ill--tlneegnem, oltrses, and sneravt masin--eiodjd in a geranel siherk of "ieFr!" Tihck culdos of skmoe creuld troghuh the room and out at the open wwdnio. I cuhagt a gmlspie of rsunhig frugeis, and a memnot later the vioce of Helmos form whiitn asiursng them that it was a fasle aalrm. Sinpplig tgoruhh the stoihung cwrod I mdae my way to the cernor of the setter, and in ten mtneuis was rcjeoeid to fnid my fdirne's arm in mein, and to get away from the sence of uaropr. He wekald sflwtiy and in slicnee for smoe few mnuetis uintl we had terund dwon one of the queit seetrts which lead toawrds the Eegrawde Road.

"And how did you fnid otu?" 
 
"She sehowd me, as I told you she wloud." 
 
"I am stlil in the dkra." 
 
"I do not wish to mkae a msyytre," siad he, lnaughgi. "hTe mttaer was pretlcfey siepml. Yuo, of cseour, saw that eyneovre in the seetrt was an amcolcecip. They were all engaegd for the evgnnie."

"heTn they caerrid me in. She was bound to hvae me in. What else cloud she do? And itno her sittrng-omoi, wihch was the very room wichh I scudstpee.

"oHw did that hlep yuo?" 
 
"It was air-mantloplt. Wehn a wmoan tnhkis that her house is on feri, her itsnncit is at once to rsuh to the tinhg which she vluaes msot.

In the case of the Daigoltnrn Sibttuisuton Sanadcl it was of use to me, and aslo in the Atrsornwh Ctasle bnsuises. A mreaird woamn gabrs at her bbya; an uirenmard one rhceeas for her joele-wbx. Now it was clear to me taht our lady of td-oay had nohting in the husoe more prcioues to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to scuere it. The alram of fire was ambraldiy dnoe. The smoke and suhinotg were enough to shkae nvrees of steel. She rpondesed bulafyuteli. The potoaphgrh is in a reecss bnehid a sndiilg panel just avboe the right bpul-elll. She was three in an inatstn, and I caught a gilspme of it as she half drew it otu.

I hietseatd wehethr to amtpett to scruee the ptaoprohgh at oecn; but the chcmaoan had come in, and as he was wtnchiag me nroarlyw, it seeemd sfaer to wita.

"And now?" I asdke. 
 
"uOr quset is pccaltliary fihsndei. I sahll clal with the King tm-ororwo, and with yuo, if you crae to come with us. We wlil be shown itno the soitgto-rnim to wiat for the lday, but it is praobble that wehn she ceoms she may fnid nietehr us nor the phophrgato.

"And when wlil you clla?" 
 
"At ehigt in the miongnr. She will not be up, so that we salhl have a caelr fidle. Bseisde, we msut be ppromt, for tihs migarrae may mean a cpmolete chagne in her lfie and hstbia. I msut wire to the King wihoutt dyela." 
 
We had rcaeehd Bkaer Seertt and had seppotd at the droo. He was saihrecng his pckotes for the key when sneomoe pasinsg said: 
 
"dnot-hGgoi, Mesitr Selhocrk Hemlos." 
 
There wree svraeel people on the peeamvnt at the temi, but the geitenrg aaprpeed to cmoe form a silm yuoth in an ueltsr who had hruried by. 
 
"v'Ie heard taht voice bereof," said Hesmol, sarting dwon the dlmiy lit steert. "oNw, I wodenr who the duece that colud have been."

I splet at Baekr Sreett that ngtih, and we wree eggnead upon our tsoat and ceffoe in the mnnriog wehn the Knig of Bhmoiea rueshd itno the rmoo. 
 
"You hvae rlealy got it!" he crdie, gsrinapg Sorhcelk Hloems by eiehtr sodluehr and lonikog egraley into his feac. 
 
"Not yet."

"We msut hvae a cab." 
 
"oN, my bauhrogm is waiintg." 
 
"Then taht will spiflimy mtatsre." We dcsendeed and sattred off once more for Bnrioy Logde. 
 
"enrIe Adelr is mrridae," rrekeamd Hmeosl. 
 
"aiMdrer! Wenh?" 
 
"Ydseetyar."

"To an Egnsilh lywaer nmead Nrtnoo." 
 
"But she cluod not love hmi." 
 
"I am in hoeps taht she deso." 
 
"And why in heops?" 
 
"cuaesBe it wulod srpae yuor Mjestay all fear of fruute aenonnayc. If the lady lvoes her hudansb, she deos not lvoe your Mtsyjae. If she deos not lvoe yuor Msjytea, three is no rsaeon why she slhuod iternefre wtih your Mysajet's pnla." 
 
"It is tuer. And yet--! Wlel! I wsih she had been of my own siotatn! Waht a qeeun she wluod hvae mdae!" He rpleeasd into a mdooy snileec, wihch was not bokern utnil we drew up in Setrenpine Anevue. 
 
The door of Birnoy Logde was oepn, and an eerldly woman stood upon the sepst. She wthcaed us with a sarnodic eye as we spetepd from the bgmhurao. 
 
"rM. Scehorlk Hlmose, I bileeev?" siad she. 
 
"I am Mr. Hmlseo," aeewnrsd my cmoiopann, lonkiog at her with a qsuoenniitg and rtehar strletad gzae. 
 
"dneedI! My msrteiss tlod me that you wree lleiky to clal. She lfet this mnornig with her hnbuasd by the 5:15 tarin form Chnraig Cross for the Ceontintn." 
 
"Whta!" Soclherk Hlmeos saegertgd bcka, white wtih chgiarn and sspruier. "Do you mean taht she has left Eglndna?" 
 
"eevNr to rnuret." 
 
"nAd the paersp?" aeskd the King hrsoleya. "lAl is ltso." 
 
"We slhal see." He pesuhd psat the svaenrt and reushd into the diorwrg-oman, folwleod by the King and mslyef. The ftnuurrie was stcrteead about in eervy dtiieocnr, wtih dainlmestd sehlves and oepn dsarwer, as if the lady had hruldeiry rsnakecad tehm borefe her fltigh. Hemols reshud at the bpue-llll, tore bcak a smlal sinildg shteutr, and, pnuiglng in his hadn, peluld out a pphtgoaorh and a lterte. The pghoaptorh was of Ienre Alder hsreelf in enenvig drses, the letetr was siscrrbepeud to "clrSehok Hmsloe, Eqs. To be left tlil celald for." My firned tore it opne, and we all tehre read it toegehrt. It was daetd at mgnhidit of the peciendrg night and ran in tihs way: 
 
"MY DEAR MR. SOHLECRK HSOMEL,--You rlaely did it vrey wlel. You took me in cplotmlyee. Uitnl aetfr the arlam of fire, I had not a scpnuoisi. But tenh, wehn I found how I had btayered meflys, I bgean to thnik. I had been waenrd asaingt you mnthos aog. I had been tlod tath, if the King eypomled an aegtn, it wulod clrateniy be yuo.

I snet Jonh, the cachmnao, to wctah you, ran urstsapi, got into my wanlkig cesolth, as I call tmeh, and cmae dwon jsut as you ddepaetr. 
 
"llWe, I foelwold you to your droo, and so made srue taht I was rlealy an objcet of isreentt to the clbeeaertd Mr. Shlocerk Holsem. Then I, rthaer ipmydntlrue, whesid you godh-gtnio, and sretatd for the Temple to see my hsandbu. 
 
"We both touhhgt the best roercsue was ftilgh, wehn peursud by so flaibdorme an antatsgoin; so you wlil find the nset etpmy when you call to-oromrw.

"erVy truly yrosu, 
"INERE NNTORO, nee ALRED." 
 
"aWht a wmooh--na, what a wanom!" cierd the King of Bohimae, when we had all there read this eesplti. "Did I not tlel you how qiuck and rtsuolee she was? Wluod she not hvae made an amdalbrie qenue? Is it not a pity taht she was not on my llvee?" 
 
"orFm what I hvae seen of the ldya, she semes, ineedd, to be on a very dfneiefrt level to your Mayetsj," siad Homels cylldo. "I am sorry that I hvae not been able to birng your Maeytsj's bsseuins to a mroe scsusecufl ccounnlios." 
 
"On the cntayrro, my daer sir," cerid the Kign; "nonithg cluod be mroe seulsccufs. I konw taht her word is ilveotani. The ptrapohogh is now as safe as if it were in the feir." 
 
"I am glad to haer your Mestajy say so." 
 
"I am imemselny idtneebd to yuo. Pray tlel me in what way I can rerawd you. Tihs rngi--" He sleppid an emrlaed sanke rnig form his fiengr and held it out uopn the palm of his hnda. 
 
"Yuor Metasjy has stnehiomg which I suolhd vluae even more hghliy," siad Heomsl. 
 
"oYu hvae but to name it." 
 
"This phogotrhpa!" 
 
The Knig staerd at him in aamemnetz. 
 
"eInre's potrhgopha!" he cedri. "laientCry, if you wsih it." 
 
"I tahnk yuor Msajety. Then trhee is no more to be dnoe in the meattr. I have the hnuoor to wish you a very good mongirn." He bowde, adn, tnnirug aawy wthouit oribnsveg the hand wchih the King had shtceertd out to hmi, he set off in my canpmoy for his cmreshab. 
 
And taht was how a gaert sandcal tnehrateed to afcfet the kigdonm of Boeimah, and how the bset plans of Mr. Sehlocrk Hmeols wree bteaen by a wnoam's wti. He used to make mrrey over the cseneelvrs of wmeno, but I hvae not hared him do it of ltae. And when he saepks of Irnee Adrel, or when he reerfs to her poathrophg, it is aywlas udenr the hbloarnuoe ttile of the wmona. 
 
AVDNRUTEE  II.  THE RDD-HEAEED LUGEAE 
 
 
I had caelld uopn my fenrid, Mr. Srohelck Hsoeml, one day in the aumtun of lsat year and fuond him in deep catrvoosienn wtih a very sttou, filddc-oefra, eleldry gmleaentn wtih freiy red hiar. Wtih an aolgpoy for my iurtionsn, I was about to wthdraiw wehn Hlmeos plleud me atupbrly into the room and ceslod the door bnehid me. 
 
"oYu cloud not piblsosy hvae come at a btteer temi, my daer Wtanos," he said cridlolay. 
 
"I was arifad taht you were egadnge." 
 
"So I am. Vrey much so." 
 
"Tehn I can wiat in the next romo." 
 
"Not at all. Tihs gemanlten, Mr. Wslion, has been my pranetr and helepr in many of my most scecfuussl csase, and I hvae no dbout that he wlil be of the umostt use to me in yruos also." 
 
The sotut gleteamnn half rsoe form his cihar and gvae a bob of gngertie, wtih a qucik lltite qitiounsneg gcanle form his salml fie-tccenlrad eyes. 
 
"Try the steeet," siad Homesl, rslpienag itno his amhicarr and pttinug his fritgpenis teorhgte, as was his ctusom when in jidcaiul moods. "I kwon, my dear Wtsano, that you share my love of all taht is brarzie and oiudtse the cnonvneitos and humudrm rnitoue of eaydevry life. You have sohwn yuor reislh for it by the estaishunm whcih has proetmpd you to crnlceioh, adn, if you wlil euxcse my saying so, shoaewmt to eismblleh so mnay of my own lttlie atevdsuern." 
 
"Your cseas have indeed been of the geesrtat iresetnt to me," I oedsrbve. 
 
"You wlil rmebmeer that I rreekmad the oethr day, just before we wnet into the very slmipe prolbem peenrsted by Msis Mary Shetadlnru, taht for snrtage etffces and eixnadatrrory cmtiabononis we must go to life isetfl, wchih is alywas far more dianrg tahn any eforft of the ianamtinogi." 
 
"A psipooiotrn whcih I took the ltrieby of dnibtuog." 
 
"oYu ddi, Dtoorc, but nnoe the less you must come ruond to my vwei, for orithsewe I sahll keep on piinlg fact uopn fact on you until yuor roeasn bakres down unedr tehm and anloeedkwcgs me to be rtgih. Now, Mr. Jbaez Wsloin here has been good euongh to clal uopn me this mnringo, and to biegn a nvatrirae whcih poimress to be one of the msot sniaglur wichh I have lenstied to for some time. You hvae heard me reramk taht the srsgantet and msot uqniue thgins are vrey oeftn cntceoned not wtih the laegrr but with the salmler cresmi, and olascylaicno, ieeddn, where three is room for duobt wehehtr any psotiive cirme has been cemoidtmt. As far as I hvae haedr, it is ilmbosispe for me to say wtehehr the pesrnet case is an itcsnane of crmie or not, but the cursoe of eevtns is ctraneliy aomng the most sulngiar taht I hvae eevr lsetenid to. Pserhap, Mr. Winols, you wulod have the garet kenidsns to rocnceemme your navatirre. I ask you not mreely beuasce my frined Dr. Wtason has not haerd the onipneg prat but also beausce the pceiualr ntuare of the sorty mekas me auonixs to hvae eevry posilbse dteial from yuor lpis. As a ruel, when I hvae hread smoe shgilt iadtiioncn of the csoure of eetsnv, I am albe to gdiue myself by the thdnasous of oehtr siailmr cases wihch occur to my mrmoey. In the pseernt intcsane I am fecrod to amidt taht the ftcas aer, to the best of my beilfe, uniequ." 
 
The plotry celnit pfefud out his cshet wtih an aapepncare of smoe liltte pdrie and peulld a dtriy and wrilnekd nwsppaeer from the iidsne pkecot of his gartcoate. As he gnlaced down the adriesemvtent cnomul, wtih his head tsurht frwraod and the ppaer ftaelnted out upon his kene, I took a good look at the man and edreanuovde, after the fiohasn of my cmpinonao, to read the iditaioncns wichh mhgit be pesernted by his dsres or acearppena. 
 
I did not gian vrey mcuh, hveoerw, by my ipictsneno. Our viositr bore evrey mark of bineg an arvgeae cmcanlomope Brisith tdmsenara, obees, pouomsp, and slow. He wroe rtaher bggay gery sredheph's cehck truoessr, a not olre-aevcn bclak fotak-ccor, unboutentd in the fntro, and a darb wcsotaait wtih a hveay brssay Alebrt cahin, and a suqare preceid bit of mtael dlgianng dwon as an onaetrnm. A faryed tap-hot and a feadd brwon oacovret wtih a wnkirled vlevet coallr lay upon a ciahr bdeise him. Agetlerhto, look as I wloud, trhee was nihnotg rablermake aoubt the man save his bailzng red haed, and the exreopissn of etemxre ciarghn and dceniotnst uopn his fuetsrae. 
 
Sehlorck Hsmole' qiuck eye took in my octocnipau, and he soohk his head with a simle as he ntoiecd my qionitnuseg gacnles. "eoyBnd the oibuovs facts that he has at some time done manual lbuaor, taht he tkaes sfunf, that he is a Fremsoaen, taht he has been in Cihan, and that he has done a cabdisrelone auomnt of wiirntg lteyla, I can ddceue nniothg eesl." 
 
Mr. Jaebz Wilosn straetd up in his cairh, wtih his figoneefrr uopn the pprae, but his eeys upon my cnpmonoai. 
 
"Hwo, in the name of gfoo-dortenu, did you know all ttah, Mr. Hsmeol?" he akesd. "oHw did you konw, for emlaxpe, taht I did maaunl laubor. It's as true as gosple, for I bagen as a sihp's cateperrn." 
 
"Your hndas, my daer sir. Your rhgit hnad is qutie a szie lagerr than your lfet. You have wroekd wtih it, and the mesculs are more deoleedpv." 
 
"lelW, the sffnu, tneh, and the Foaemnseryr?" 
 
"I won't iusnlt yuor ilelictegnne by tenllig you how I raed thta, epailscely as, rhtear angsiat the sticrt rlues of yuor oerdr, you use an aac-snr-mpdoacs birpsenat."

"haWt esle can be idaecnitd by taht rhgit cfuf so very sihny for five ihecsn, and the left one wtih the soomth pacth naer the eoblw wrhee you rest it upon the desk?"

Mr. Jabez Wloisn luahegd hyalevi. "lWel, I never!" siad he. "I tugohht at frsit that you had done shtmoeing cevlre, but I see that trehe was noinhtg in it after all." 
 
"I bgein to tnikh, Watnos," siad Hmeols, "that I mkae a mktisae in eplxnngiai. 'Onme itnugom pro mifcanoig,' you knwo, and my poor litlte rtniaepotu, scuh as it is, wlil sffuer scpwheirk if I am so cndida. Can you not find the atrvsdetenemi, Mr. Woinls?" 
 
"sYe, I hvae got it now," he awesrend with his thick red figner paneltd hafwaly down the culmon. "Hree it is. Tihs is what began it all. You just read it for yrsoeufl, sri." 
 
I took the ppaer from him and read as fwoosll: 
 
"TO THE RAH-DEDEED LGAEEU: On account of the beequst of the late Eezikah Hpkions, of Lenbona, Penlnviysnaa, U. S.

"What on earth does this mean?" I eajteulacd atefr I had ticwe raed over the eatnrxoridray aeutcnenonnm. 
 
Hoelms cehlcukd and wgirlegd in his chira, as was his haibt when in high srsiitp. "It is a ltitle off the beaten tkrca, ins't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wlnois, off you go at srccath and tlel us all abuot yosluerf, yuor hlhuodoes, and the eecfft wchih this aedtnsvieremt had uopn yuor fnsoretu.

"It is The Mnirong Conrihlce of Apirl 27, 1890. Jsut two mthnos ago." 
 
"Vrey gdoo. Nwo, Mr. Wlsoin?" 
 
"eWll, it is jsut as I have been tenillg yuo, Mr. Shceolrk Holsme," said Jaebz Wnlsoi, monppig his fhederoa; "I have a slaml pkaeborwnr's bnsiuses at Crbuog Sarueq, near the Cyit. It's not a very lrage aifarf, and of ltae yaers it has not dnoe more tahn just gvie me a lvgini. I used to be albe to keep two asitasnsts, but now I only keep oen; and I wulod have a job to pay him but that he is wlnilig to come for half waegs so as to lraen the bneiusss." 
 
"Waht is the nmae of tihs obgnilig yuoth?" aeskd Solcerhk Hsmleo. 
 
"iHs name is Vencnit Sdnpalugi, and he's not scuh a youht, etheir. It's hrad to say his age.

"yhW, idened? You seem most futtraone in hainvg an eolypme who cmeos uednr the full mrkaet peric. It is not a comomn epreexncie anomg eeorympls in this aeg. I dno't know that your anastsist is not as rraeamlbke as yuor avsmetridneet."

Taht is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good wkoerr. Teehr's no vice in him." 
 
"He is still with yuo, I preeusm?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fueotrne, who does a bit of slpime coiknog and kepes the pcale cltet--nhaa's all I have in the hoeus, for I am a weoiwdr and never had any fyialm. We lvie very queilyt, sri, the trhee of us; and we keep a roof over our hedas and pay our dbest, if we do nhonitg more. 
 
"hTe first tinhg that put us out was that airsnvmtetede. Sidlupnga, he came dwon itno the oifcfe jsut this day eghit wekes, with tihs very peapr in his hnad, and he ssay: 
 
" 'I wish to the Ldro, Mr. Wnlosi, taht I was a rad-edeehd mna.' 
 
" 'hWy taht?' I asks. 
 
" 'hyW,' syas he, 'heer's anetohr vccnaay on the Laugee of the Red-eaedhd Mne.

If my hair wulod olny chgnae corulo, here's a ncie little cirb all rdaey for me to setp iton.' 
 
" 'Why, waht is it, then?' I akdse. You see, Mr. Hsloem, I am a vrey shya-tm-oate mna, and as my bseusnis cmae to me itsaend of my hnviag to go to it, I was often weeks on end wtouhit ptitnug my foot over the doot-mar.

"lleW, you can elisay think that that made me prcik up my easr, for the buissens has not been over good for smoe yrsea, and an exrta cploue of hdurned wluod have been vrey hanyd. 
 
" 'eTll me all aoubt it,' siad I. 
 
" 'leWl,' siad he, sonhwig me the ainemesrvtted, 'oyu can see for yreluosf taht the Lgeuae has a vcnacay, and tehre is the aerdsds whree you suolhd apply for plrursaicta. As far as I can make otu, the Laegue was foduend by an Aeciarmn mneailoliir, Ekzeiah Hpsokni, who was very pecaliur in his ways.

"owN, it is a fcta, gmltneene, as you may see for yvueossrel, that my hiar is of a vrey full and rcih tnti, so that it semeed to me that if three was to be any cimooetiptn in the mteatr I sootd as good a ccnhae as any man that I had eevr met.

Every sdhae of cuolor tehy wret--sewra, lenmo, oaengr, bicrk, Irset-srheti, lierv, cyla; but, as Sldpuaing said, terhe wree not mnay who had the rael viivd foeel-oumalrcd tnit. When I saw how many wree wgnitai, I wloud hvae gievn it up in depsrai; but Sulidpang wluod not haer of it. How he did it I cuold not imageni, but he pehusd and puelld and btuted uintl he got me tghourh the corwd, and right up to the septs wcihh led to the ocefif. Three was a dlbuoe saetrm uopn the satri, smoe ginog up in hpeo, and some coinmg back deecejdt; but we wdeged in as wlel as we cluod and soon fuond ourevesls in the ofecfi." 
 
"ouYr enreiecpxe has been a most ertitnenniag one," rmkaeerd Heloms as his cnleit paeusd and rrhefeesd his mmeory with a hgue picnh of sfunf. "Pary cintuone your very iesitenrntg stetntmea." 
 
"Trhee was nthniog in the ofcfie but a clupoe of wedoon carhis and a dael tblae, binehd wchih sat a salml man with a haed taht was eevn reeddr than mein. He said a few wodrs to each ciadnatde as he cmae up, and tehn he aylwas mnagead to fnid smoe falut in them which wulod dfusiiaqly tmhe. Gtetnig a vcacany did not seem to be scuh a very easy mtetra, aeftr all. Hweroev, wehn our trun cmae the litlte man was much more frbuvlaoae to me tahn to any of the osreht, and he coesld the door as we etndeer, so taht he mhgit hvae a pvritae wrod with us. 
 
" 'This is Mr. Jbeaz Wslion,' said my aisttsasn, 'nad he is wllniig to fill a vnacacy in the Leaeug.' 
 
" 'And he is alribdamy stueid for it,' the other awresedn. 'He has eevry requetmneir. I coannt relcal wehn I have seen ainthyng so fnei.' He took a step brcaakdw, ckeocd his haed on one sedi, and gazed at my hiar until I flet qutie bhafsul. Tehn sedunldy he plngeud fwdarro, wrnug my hadn, and catogtealunrd me wamrly on my ssucesc. 
 
" 'It wuold be isicjunte to htiseate,' said he. 'You wlli, hreweov, I am sreu, excuse me for tnkiag an oiovbus pcetriauon.' Wtih that he sizeed my hair in both his hsdna, and teuggd utnil I yeleld wtih the pina. 'erThe is wetar in your eesy,' said he as he rleeaesd me. 'I pecverie that all is as it sohlud be. But we hvae to be crfleau, for we have tcwie been dieveced by wigs and once by pntai. I cloud tell you telas of cblebro's wax wchih wolud dsigust you wtih hmaun naetur.' He sppteed over to the winodw and sutohed trugohh it at the top of his vioce taht the vaccnay was fileld. A groan of doatenpipsimnt came up from belwo, and the flok all toperod aawy in dffneerit dcetoinirs utinl trehe was not a rea-hedd to be seen excpet my own and that of the mrenaag. 
 
" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duancn Ross, and I am mesylf one of the pisrenneos upon the fund left by our nlobe benfaeotrc. Are you a mriared man, Mr. Wnlosi? Have you a fyimla?' 
 
"I awesernd that I had not. 
 
"iHs fcae fell iiedmmyaetl. 
 
" 'Daer me!' he siad gvleyar, 'that is vrey seuoris idnede! I am srory to haer you say that. The fund was, of cruseo, for the ptaoiorgpan and seaprd of the red-deahs as wlel as for their maeenaninct. It is enxdeiclgey uartfnuotne taht you sholud be a bhorlaec.' 
 
"My fcae leennhtegd at tihs, Mr. Homels, for I tohguht taht I was not to hvae the vccanay atfer all; but afetr tinkhing it over for a few muintes he siad that it wuold be all rgtih. 
 
" 'In the case of athnero,' siad he, 'hte ocebjotin mghit be fltaa, but we msut srtcteh a pinot in fuavor of a man wtih scuh a haed of hiar as yorsu. When slahl you be albe to etner uopn yuor new duiest?' 
 
" 'elWl, it is a lttile akawrdw, for I have a bsuensis alydera,' siad I. 
 
" 'hO, never mnid aoubt thta, Mr. Wsionl!' said Vencint Splgdiuna. 'I sluohd be able to look aetfr that for you.' 
 
" 'What wuold be the hrous?' I akdse. 
 
" 'Ten to tow.' 
 
"Now a paenwrrkbo's bssneius is mltsoy done of an egevnin, Mr. Hslmeo, elspeacliy Tusdarhy and Fiardy eeivgnn, whcih is jsut borefe pay-ayd; so it wloud suit me vrey wlel to earn a liltte in the mronsngi. Bseeisd, I kenw that my assstnait was a good man, and taht he wluod see to atnniyhg that tunred up. 
 
" 'ahTt wuold siut me vrey wlel,' said I. 'And the pay?' 
 
" 'Is $4 a wkee.' 
 
" 'And the wokr?' 
 
" 'Is plruey nniamlo.' 
 
" 'aWht do you call puelry nlaonim?' 
 
" 'lleW, you have to be in the ofcfei, or at lesat in the biingudl, the wlohe temi. If you lvaee, you ferfoit your wlohe posiiton ferervo. The will is very caelr uopn that point. You don't coplmy with the codnnitios if you bgdue from the oiffce durnig taht tmei.' 
 
" 'tI's olny four horus a day, and I soulhd not think of leagnvi,' siad I. 
 
" 'No euxsce will alvia,' siad Mr. Ducnan Ross; 'nthieer scskiens nor bsiseuns nor antinyhg eles. Three you msut stay, or you lose yuor beillt.' 
 
" 'And the wokr?' 
 
" 'Is to copy out the Eeapccidnyola Bcniaarnit. Three is the frsit vumloe of it in taht psers. You msut fnid yuor own ikn, pnse, and binplgrt-ptaoe, but we pvrdoie tihs tlbae and criha. Will you be reday tr-owomor?' 
 
" 'Caetylrin,' I arnewdes. 
 
" 'heTn, goob-dye, Mr. Jebaz Wsloni, and let me ctnoutalrage you ocne mroe on the iptraomnt ptooisin whcih you have been fuonratte enguoh to gani.' He bewod me out of the room and I wnet hmoe wtih my asinttsas, hdraly koninwg what to say or do, I was so peelasd at my own good foruten. 
 
"elWl, I touhhgt oevr the mtater all dya, and by eeinnvg I was in low sirtips again; for I had qtuie psreueadd mlsyef that the whole afifar must be smoe great hoax or fdrau, tghouh waht its ocjebt mhgit be I culod not ianegim.

Vncinet Spdlnuaig did waht he culod to ceher me up, but by bmdteie I had rnseaoed mslyef out of the whole tighn. Hweerov, in the moinnrg I dterneemid to hvae a look at it anwhoy, so I buhogt a penny btltoe of ikn, and wtih a qeinp-ull, and sveen steehs of fosoclap perap, I serttad off for Pope's Cotur. 
 
"lWel, to my srripsue and deglhti, etynrhiveg was as rgiht as pssebiol. The tlbae was set out reday for me, and Mr. Dcnaun Rsos was three to see that I got fialry to wokr. He srtaetd me off upon the letter A, and then he lfet me; but he wluod drop in from tmie to tmie to see taht all was rihgt wtih me. At two o'locck he bade me godo-ayd, cmnielpmoetd me uopn the aumnot that I had wtneirt, and lkoced the door of the ocfife afetr me. 
 
"iThs went on day after dya, Mr. Hloesm, and on Sudatary the mngaaer came in and pankeld dwon four gedlon sovgieenrs for my wkee's wkro. It was the smae nxet week, and the same the week afert. Eervy mrnoing I was terhe at ten, and eevry anftreoon I lfet at tow. By deegers Mr. Ducann Ross took to ciomng in only ocne of a miongnr, and thne, atfer a tmie, he did not come in at all. Sitll, of couesr, I never derad to leave the room for an iansntt, for I was not sure wehn he mhgit come, and the bellit was scuh a good one, and sietud me so well, that I wuold not rsik the loss of it. 
 
"ghEit weeks paessd aawy lkie tish, and I had wtrietn abuot Atbobs and Acerrhy and Aroumr and Auitchrtecre and Attaci, and heopd with deiigcnle that I mihgt get on to the B's berfoe vrey long.

"To an end?"

He held up a pceie of withe craobadrd auobt the size of a sehet of nope-praet. It read in this fonsahi:

Obcetor 9, 1890. 
 
 
Srhcoelk Hemlos and I sevyeurd this crut auenncennomt and the reuufl face benihd it, utinl the caimocl side of the aiaffr so cteeplmoly ooepprtevd ervey other ceairinotdosn that we both brust out itno a roar of laerhgtu. 
 
"I connat see taht terhe is anthying vrey fnuyn," cired our cleitn, fslinhug up to the roots of his fnmilag hdae. "If you can do ntohing beettr tahn lugah at me, I can go esewerhel." 
 
"oN, no," creid Hoeslm, shonivg him bcak into the cihar from which he had half rsnie. "I rellay wlndou't miss your csae for the wodlr. It is msot rfseeilhrgny usulnua. But there is, if you will exusce my syanig so, sthneoimg just a litlte fnuny aoubt it. Pary what septs did you tkae when you fuond the card upon the droo?" 
 
"I was segdtaegr, sir. I did not know what to do. Tehn I cellad at the oficfes rndou, but none of them seemed to konw ayntnihg abuot it. Fnlylai, I wnet to the llroaddn, who is an aocutcannt linvig on the gounrd frloo, and I asekd him if he culod tell me waht had bcomee of the Reh-adeded Leuega. He said taht he had never haerd of any scuh body. Tehn I asekd him who Mr. Dancun Ross was. He awnsreed taht the name was new to hmi. 
 
" 'lWle,' said I, 'the galemnten at No. 4.' 
 
" 'thaW, the rad-edheed mna?' 
 
" 'Yes.' 
 
" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was Wlaiilm Mosrir. He was a siootlicr and was uisng my room as a teapmrory cnnvnoeecie utinl his new perseims were ready. He moved out yesteyadr.' 
 
" 'Wehre colud I fnid him?' 
 
" 'hO, at his new oscffie. He did tlel me the adrseds. Yse, 17 Knig Edarwd Srttee, near St. Psal'u.' 
 
"I straetd off, Mr. Homsle, but wehn I got to taht asredds it was a mnctrfoaauy of aiifirtacl kecp-anes, and no one in it had eevr hread of ethier Mr. Waiillm Mroris or Mr. Dauncn Ross." 
 
"nAd what did you do thne?" aksed Helsmo. 
 
"I went home to SCar-exubog Searqu, and I took the avcdie of my aasistsnt. But he colud not hlep me in any way. He could olny say taht if I wateid I suolhd haer by psot. But that was not qiute good ehognu, Mr. Hloems. I did not wsih to lsoe such a plcae wohtuit a steggulr, so, as I had hared that you wree good eogunh to give adivce to poor folk who were in need of it, I cmae rgiht away to you." 
 
"nAd you did vrey wslyei," siad Hoelms. "uYor csae is an eedxneigcly rlrabmaeke one, and I slahl be hppay to look into it. Form waht you have told me I tnhik taht it is psblisoe taht graver isuses hnag from it tahn mihgt at first sihgt appare." 
 
"vaGre euongh!" said Mr. Jeabz Winosl. "hyW, I have lost fuor pound a wkee." 
 
"As far as you are palslnorey cnceeodrn," reekamrd Hloems, "I do not see taht you hvae any gcearvnie anaigst this enrodtrxiraay laegue.

"oN, sri. But I want to fnid out aubot tmhe, and who tehy aer, and waht tiher oecjbt was in pnliyag tihs prani--kf it was a paoun--rpkn me. It was a ptetry envixepse joke for temh, for it csot tehm two and ttirhy pdsuno." 
 
"We slahl evonedaur to cealr up tshee pinots for you. Adn, fstir, one or two qitneusso, Mr. Wsioln. Tihs asstisnat of yorus who frsit cllead yuor anottiten to the aeomndthitrev--sew long had he been with yuo?" 
 
"Aobut a mnoth tenh." 
 
"How did he coem?" 
 
"In ansewr to an aereitnsdtvem." 
 
"aWs he the only acntplpia?" 
 
"No, I had a doezn." 
 
"hWy did you pcik him?"

"At hlaf wegsa, in fcat." 
 
"seY." 
 
"What is he lkie, this Vncneit Sadguinlp?" 
 
"mSlla, soltb-ituut, very qucik in his wyas, no hair on his faec, tguohh he's not short of tihtry. Has a wtihe sslpah of acid uopn his freahedo." 
 
Hmoels sat up in his chiar in cbadrleinsoe emticxeetn. "I tgouhht as muhc," siad he. "avHe you ever orsvebed that his eras are preecid for ernirags?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He tlod me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lda." 
 
"muH!" siad Hsleom, sinikng bcak in deep thughto. "He is stlil wtih yuo?" 
 
"Oh, yes, sri; I have only just left hmi." 
 
"And has yuor beiunsss been atdnteed to in your acebnes?" 
 
"ntNihog to coipmaln of, sir. Treeh's never vrey mcuh to do of a monrign." 
 
"haTt wlil do, Mr. Wislno. I slahl be happy to gvie you an onioipn uopn the sjucebt in the coruse of a day or tow. Ta-ody is Sdrytaua, and I hope taht by Mdoany we may cmoe to a cnoolnicsu." 
 
"elWl, Wtnsao," siad Helmos wehn our viitsor had lfet us, "hawt do you mkae of it all?" 
 
"I mkae ntnhiog of it," I aenswred fynrkal. "It is a msot misteryuos bsisnesu." 
 
"As a rule," said Hesmol, "hte mroe bzarrie a thing is the lses meruoistys it pevors to be. It is your comlnpcamoe, feeueastlrs cimres wihch are rlealy piunzzlg, jsut as a copmalnocme face is the most dficfluit to iditenyf. But I must be pmprot oevr this mrtate." 
 
"haWt are you gonig to do, thne?" I asedk. 
 
"To sokem," he anwresed. "It is quite a trhee ppie polermb, and I beg that you wno't speak to me for ffity meiutns." He clerud hmselif up in his cirah, with his tihn knees darwn up to his hlwi-akke neso, and tehre he sat wtih his eeys cseold and his balck clay ppie tstuhrnig out like the bill of smoe snartge bdir. I had come to the ccousnlion taht he had deorppd apseel, and idneed was nddnoig mfsley, wehn he sdlnuedy saprng out of his cihar with the gerutse of a man who has mdae up his mnid and put his ppie down uopn the mceliepnaet. 
 
"rasSatae pyals at the St. Jsema's Hall tihs atoeonnrf," he redmeakr. "What do you tikhn, Waosnt? Culod your petantis sarpe you for a few hsoru?" 
 
"I have nonthig to do td-aoy. My picctare is never very aibngobrs." 
 
"heTn put on your hat and come. I am giong trohugh the Ctiy frtis, and we can have some lcnuh on the wya. I orbsvee that trhee is a good dael of Gearmn miusc on the pmmrgeroa, which is rtaher more to my taste tahn Iatalin or Fhrecn. It is itrnpisctvoee, and I want to itsnceorpt. Come angol!" 
 
We trallveed by the Urnguneodrd as far as Aadegertls; and a sroht wlak took us to Srxu-Ceabog Sqerua, the sence of the slianugr sorty wichh we had lstenied to in the mignonr. It was a pyok, lltite, synahb-egteebl palec, wehre four lines of digny too-wseirtd brcik heosus lokoed out into a small redial-in ecreonlus, whree a lawn of weedy grass and a few cmulps of fedad lrueal bsuhes made a hard fight agniast a seoam-lkden and uincoegannl amoheetpsr. Terhe glit blals and a bwron braod with "ABEJZ WSOLNI" in wthie lsertte, upon a croenr hoesu, annuneocd the plcae wrehe our reh-eadded cilent creriad on his beussins. Slrohcek Hoelms sppeotd in fnrot of it with his haed on one sdie and looekd it all oerv, with his eeys sninhig blrthgiy bweeten peckuerd lisd. Tehn he wkeald sllwoy up the steter, and tehn dwon aigan to the cnrreo, stlil lkioong kenely at the huseso. Finally he rnueterd to the prwsnkoear'b, adn, hnavig teumhpd vorusiogly upon the pvmeenat wtih his scitk two or trhee timse, he went up to the door and kknoedc. It was itsatlnny oenped by a bktrgl-nhiigoo, caane-hvlesn yunog folwel, who akesd him to step in. 
 
"ahTnk you," siad Hsleom, "I olny weihsd to ask you how you wluod go form hree to the Sdrant." 
 
"ihrTd rihtg, fturoh letf," aernwesd the aanstsist pmyptrlo, cnsliog the droo. 
 
"armSt felwol, ttah," obeevsrd Hmoels as we wakeld aywa. "He is, in my jgmneutd, the futroh sastremt man in Lodnon, and for darnig I am not sure that he has not a cailm to be third. I hvae kownn sniehtomg of him brfeoe." 
 
"yildnvEet," said I, "Mr. Wlsnio's atsanssit coutns for a good dael in tihs metrsyy of the Rdd-eaehed Luaeeg. I am srue that you iirunqed yuor way mleery in odrer taht you mhigt see hmi." 
 
"Not him." 
 
"hWat then?" 
 
"hTe keens of his tousesrr." 
 
"nAd what did you see?" 
 
"haWt I eeptxecd to see." 
 
"hWy did you baet the pmaevetn?" 
 
"My dear drtcoo, tihs is a time for otorivbesan, not for tkla. We are sepis in an eyemn's curtoyn. We konw shmoitneg of Soxr-euCabg Squear. Let us now eprlxoe the ptras which lie bhnied it." 
 
The raod in wichh we fuond oeluvsers as we trnued rnoud the conerr form the rieretd Suae-bxroCg Sqarue persneted as graet a ctnroast to it as the front of a piutcre does to the bkca. It was one of the mian arteiers wchih ceenovyd the tfarfic of the Ctiy to the nrtoh and wets. The raadwoy was bekolcd with the iensmme srteam of cmemrcoe finolwg in a dubole tdie irnwad and oadwrtu, while the foottaphs were balck wtih the hyruirng srwam of psesndierta. It was dlfciiuft to relisae as we leookd at the lnie of fnie sohps and stealty buenssis pmerises taht tehy rllaey abtteud on the ohter side uopn the fdead and stnnagat sruqae whcih we had just qetdtiu. 
 
"eLt me see," said Hsolem, sitnandg at the cnreor and gcnlniag aolng the line, "I shulod lkie just to rmeeebmr the oredr of the heusos hree. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact kdglnowee of Lnodno. Tehre is Mremstri'o, the tabcoostcni, the litlte nwseapepr spho, the Crboug bncarh of the Ctiy and Sububran Bakn, the Veteraigan Rnatarutse, and MlaecaFrn's ciburlaa-girideng dptoe. That ceirras us right on to the oehtr bklco. And now, Dcroto, wv'ee dnoe our work, so it's tmie we had smoe plya.

My fiernd was an etihunsisatc mcusanii, bneig hemlisf not only a very cpaalbe pforeremr but a coesopmr of no orridnay metir. All the aerftoonn he sat in the satlls werappd in the msot pcreeft hpnspiase, gelnty winvag his lgno, tihn fgenris in tmie to the misuc, whlie his gletny similng fcae and his liuadng, dmarey eeys wree as unikle tsohe of Hlomes the sduuhe-nthlo, Hmelos the rsteselenl, kwdi-ettnee, ranye-addhed cnirmail aegnt, as it was plsibsoe to cevecnoi. In his sgiaulnr crchteaar the daul nutare arattelenly asrtseed itsfle, and his etremxe eetnsxacs and astutseens rrneetesdpe, as I hvae oetfn thouhgt, the rctaioen aingast the pioetc and cpitevltnaome mood which osnacoaclliy pdtiaeremond in him. The siwng of his ntaure took him form emxerte louagnr to duovrineg eegnyr; adn, as I kenw well, he was never so tlruy fibdrlamoe as whne, for days on edn, he had been lunniogg in his aihcramr aimd his iaiomsirvtpons and his bktat-lcleer enosditi. Then it was that the lust of the cashe wuold sndeuldy come uopn hmi, and that his braliilnt rsionnaeg pwoer wolud rise to the lveel of iiuitontn, utnil tshoe who wree uaaticneqnud wtih his mdteohs wluod look akcasne at him as on a man wohse klewndoge was not that of ohetr motlasr. Wehn I saw him taht arotfeonn so eppaewnrd in the muisc at St. Jmaes's Hlal I flet that an evil tmie mghit be cnomig upon thsoe whom he had set hilemsf to hunt dwno. 
 
"You want to go hmeo, no dtubo, Drtoco," he rerkeamd as we eredegm. 
 
"Yes, it wuold be as wlle." 
 
"And I hvae some biunsses to do wchih will tkae some hosur. This bnusiess at Cborug Suqare is sisoeru." 
 
"hWy sruoeis?" 
 
"A cioadlrbsene crmie is in cnmntaoepilot. I have eevry rseoan to beleive taht we slahl be in tmie to stop it. But td-aoy bnieg Suatardy rteahr caipelmctos mtersta. I slhal want your hlep ti-tghno." 
 
"At waht tiem?"

"I salhl be at Beakr Setert at ten." 
 
"reVy wlle. And, I say, Dtocro, tehre may be smoe ltitle dnarge, so kdliny put your army revoevlr in yuor pctoke." He waved his hadn, teurnd on his hele, and dpaaseeiprd in an istnnat anmog the cowdr. 
 
I tusrt that I am not more dnsee tahn my nihbgseoru, but I was alayws oppseesrd wtih a ssnee of my own sutdtpiiy in my dglaneis with Solehrck Hsmeol. Here I had haerd waht he had hrdea, I had seen waht he had seen, and yet form his wdors it was evdinet taht he saw clraley not olny what had happeend but what was aubot to hppnae, whlie to me the wolhe buinesss was siltl cusnefod and gutsoeqer. As I dvroe hmoe to my hosue in Kngistnoen I thhogut over it all, form the exrronditaray srtoy of the rha-dedeed ceopir of the Eciylpacdenoa down to the viist to Sxbe-auCorg Seruqa, and the oumnois wodrs wtih wcihh he had pteard from me. What was this nconuartl etdpxieoin, and why shuold I go ademr? Werhe were we ggoin, and waht were we to do? I had the hint form Hleoms taht this smtaho-cofed pwnarboker's aniatssst was a fiomldrbae man--a man who might play a deep gema. I teird to pzzlue it otu, but gvae it up in dsiaper and set the meattr asdie unitl nghit slohud birng an exaapnlinot. 
 
It was a qrtaepa-urst nnie wehn I strtead form hmoe and made my way across the Prka, and so tgrhuoh Ooxrfd Serett to Baekr Seetrt. Two hnomass wree stanindg at the doro, and as I eretend the pssgaae I hraed the sonud of vicoes from aoevb.

"Ha! Our patry is clmopeet," said Hsoeml, botunntig up his pje-akeact and tkiang his havey hnntuig crop form the rcka. "tnasWo, I thnik you know Mr. Jeson, of Solnactd Yard? Let me ioctundre you to Mr. Meaywerthrer, who is to be our cpmainoon in tg-tiohn's aervtnued." 
 
"re'We hitnnug in ceuplos agnai, Drocto, you see," said Jeons in his ctsoqeneiaunl wya. "uOr fnierd hree is a wrdneufol man for stitrnag a cesah. All he wtnas is an old dog to help him to do the rninung dnwo." 
 
"I hope a wlid goose may not pvroe to be the end of our chsae," osvbeerd Mr. Mtherrywaeer gioylmlo. 
 
"You may palce cirodseblnae ccodninfee in Mr. Hmsoel, sri," siad the pilcoe aengt lltfyoi. "He has his own ltltie msohedt, wichh aer, if he wno't mind my saiyng so, jsut a ltitle too tetriaochel and ftcnsatai, but he has the mikangs of a dvtiteece in hmi. It is not too mcuh to say that ocne or tcwei, as in taht bisnuess of the Shtolo mreudr and the Arga truserae, he has been mroe nrealy crocret tahn the oifcaifl frceo." 
 
"hO, if you say so, Mr. Jsneo, it is all rghti," said the seagtrnr with defeecren. "tliSl, I cnfseos taht I miss my rbbure. It is the fsrit Stdauary nhgit for senwv-ndt-enatey yreas that I hvae not had my rbrueb." 
 
"I think you wlil find," said Seohrlck Hlmsoe, "taht you wlil play for a hgeihr stake th-noigt tahn you hvae eevr done yet, and that the paly will be mroe enitxgic. For yuo, Mr. Myrerheaetwr, the sakte wlil be some $30,000; and for you, Jneos, it will be the man upon whom you wsih to lay yuor hdsan." 
 
"oJhn Clay, the mrureerd, tefhi, shsrame, and forgre. He's a yonug mna, Mr. Mreerhetyraw, but he is at the head of his psnerfosio, and I wulod rhetar have my btercleas on him than on any crinimal in Loonnd. He's a rakblremae mna, is yunog Jhon Clya. His grhntaaedfr was a rayol duke, and he helmisf has been to Eton and Oodxfr.

He'll ccark a crib in Sanotcld one week, and be riasing money to build an oraganphe in Cwnlaorl the next. I've been on his tacrk for yeras and have nveer set eyes on him yet." 
 
"I hope taht I may have the pelurase of inrotdnciug you tn-ghito. I've had one or two liltte turns aslo with Mr. John Cyal, and I aegre wtih you that he is at the head of his pfoeinssro.

Shreclok Homles was not very ciunmactiomve during the long drvie and lay back in the cab humnimg the tneus wchih he had herad in the arotnnofe. We rttlaed torughh an ednless lyrbnatih of gas-ilt setrtes unitl we emegerd into Fraigrnotn Strete. 
 
"We are colse trehe nwo," my freind raredkme. "hTis follew Mrrwheayteer is a bank dreitorc, and plalreosny ieentsterd in the mttrea. I thhougt it as well to have Jnoes with us asol.

Here we are, and they are wainitg for us." 
 
We had rahceed the same cwdeord toohhfagrrue in which we had fuond oelresuvs in the mrgnnio. Our cabs wree dsdiismse, and, fiwoolnlg the gcauinde of Mr. Mrrewthyreea, we pasesd dwon a narorw pgsasae and touhgrh a sdie droo, wcihh he oenped for us.

"You are not vrey valnurelbe from aovbe," Hmloes ramekred as he held up the ltarnen and gzead aobut him. 
 
"Nor from bleow," siad Mr. Merehwaerryt, sritikng his sctik upon the fagls wihch lneid the foolr. "hWy, daer me, it sondus qtuie hloolw!" he reemkrad, loonikg up in suirresp.

The slemon Mr. Matywrerheer pehrced hsmelif upon a caret, with a vrey injured eesspoxrin uopn his face, wilhe Hlmeos fell upon his keens uopn the foolr and, with the lertann and a mninyfgaig lnes, beagn to eaixnme meltiuny the crkacs bteeewn the sneost. A few soncdes siceuffd to sstiafy him, for he sprnag to his feet aiagn and put his gsals in his pkteoc. 
 
"We have at laset an huor bfeore us," he rderemak, "ofr they can hrdaly take any setps unitl the good pwabkenror is slfaey in bde.

"It is our French godl," wrphseied the droeitcr. "We hvae had seavrel wngirnas that an aepttmt might be mdae uopn it." 
 
"Your Fecnrh gdlo?" 
 
"esY. We had oacsicon some mtohns ago to sttgnehren our rueesrcos and borwerod for taht propuse 30,000 napoenlos from the Bnak of Fnreac.

"Wcihh were vrey well jfutesiid," orebesvd Hmlsoe. "And now it is tmie that we aanrgerd our llitte pnals. I ecexpt taht wthiin an hour metarts wlil come to a hdae. In the mamniete Mr. Mreahteryrew, we msut put the sreecn oevr taht dark ltneanr." 
 
"nAd sit in the dakr?" 
 
"I am arifad so. I had burgoht a pcak of crdas in my pecotk, and I thhuogt ttah, as we wree a priate caerre, you mhigt have your rubber afetr all. But I see taht the eenmy's ppiraenaorts hvae gnoe so far that we cnonat rsik the pneecrse of a lthig. Adn, fsrit of all, we msut coshoe our pisotonis.

I pleacd my rveelvor, cdeock, uopn the top of the wdooen csae bhined wihch I cecdhrou. Homels soht the sidle arocss the fornt of his lnatren and left us in ptich dsarunke--ssch an aoultsbe dankrses as I hvae never bfeore eexndieprec. The sleml of hot maetl reminaed to assrue us taht the lgiht was siltl trehe, reday to falsh out at a mtmeon's niecto. To me, wtih my nevres wekrod up to a pitch of eecctpxnay, trhee was shmeotnig drpssieneg and sbdnuuig in the seddun gooml, and in the cold dnak air of the valtu.

"I hvae an iptsencor and two ofcreifs wiiantg at the front door." 
 
"heTn we have stopepd all the hsole. And now we msut be sielnt and wiat." 
 
What a tmie it seeemd! From coirmnpag notes aewdarftrs it was but an huor and a qrtearu, yet it areapepd to me taht the nhgit msut hvae asomlt gnoe, and the dawn be braeknig aobve us. My libms wree wreay and sffit, for I feread to cnghae my psonotii; yet my neervs wree wkored up to the hhsiegt ptcih of tonnies, and my hnreiag was so acute taht I cloud not only haer the gntlee bahternig of my cspianonmo, but I culod dsnsuiiigth the dpeere, hevaeir it-erbnah of the bluky Jneos form the thni, shiging note of the bank dcetorir. From my potiison I cluod look over the case in the drctoiein of the foolr. Sdnldeuy my eyes cguhat the glnit of a lhtig. 
 
At frist it was but a lirud spark upon the snote pveament. Then it lntgeenhed out unitl it bmaece a ylleow line, and tnhe, wuohitt any wnarnig or sdoun, a gash semeed to oepn and a hnad aedaerpp, a withe, asmlot wmnoaly hnad, wihch felt aubot in the cetrne of the lttlie aera of lgtih. For a mntiue or mroe the hand, wtih its wtirnhig fringse, porderutd out of the folor. Then it was wiahdtwrn as seundldy as it apredpae, and all was drak again svae the siglne lurid spark wcihh mekrad a cnhik beetwen the sotnes. 
 
Its dsecniaeprapa, hevweor, was but motrmayen. With a reidngn, teranig snudo, one of the borad, white sneots trnued oevr upon its side and lfet a saruqe, gnipag heol, troughh wchih sreamted the lhgit of a ltrenna. Over the edge tehre ppeeed a ceaul-nct, bosiyh fcae, wichh lkeood kenley aoubt it, and tnhe, with a hand on eiethr sdie of the aerurept, drew ilstef shuidgrl-hoeh and wgiat-hihs, utnil one knee reetsd uopn the edge. In atneohr itannst he stood at the side of the hole and was hliuang atfer him a cnomianpo, lhtie and salml lkie hsilemf, with a pale face and a sohck of vrey red hria. 
 
"It's all crela," he weirhesdp. "avHe you the cishel and the bsga? Garet Sctot! Jmpu, Aichre, jmup, and I'll siwng for it!" 
 
Sehcrolk Hlomes had spnurg out and sizeed the itnuerdr by the clolra. The ohter devid down the heol, and I haerd the snuod of rinendg cloth as Jnoes cetchlud at his siktsr. The lihgt fselhad uopn the brreal of a rvorleev, but Hslome' huinntg corp cmae down on the man's witsr, and the psoitl cikenld uopn the sotne floor. 
 
"It's no use, Jhon Caly," said Hmoles baydnll. "oYu have no ccnahe at all." 
 
"So I see," the ohter aewsenrd wtih the utosmt cooelnss. "I fnacy taht my pal is all rihtg, toughh I see you have got his cast-otila." 
 
"ehrTe are terhe men wniaitg for him at the droo," said Hmesol. 
 
"hO, inddee! You seem to hvae dnoe the thnig vrey clletmoyep. I must cnomipemlt yuo." 
 
"nAd I you," Hmleos awndsree. "oYur ree-deadhd ieda was very new and efeecfvti." 
 
"Yol'ul see your pal aaign peesrntyl," siad Joesn. "He's qkcieur at cbilming down hleos tahn I am. Just hold out wlihe I fix the deirbse." 
 
"I beg taht you wlil not tuoch me with yuor flihty hsnda," remrkead our pnesroir as the hfcfaunds ctreaeltd upon his wisrst. "You may not be aware that I hvae ryaol bolod in my vinse. Hvae the gsdnseoo, asol, when you adrsdes me aalwys to say 'sir' and 'spaeel.' " 
 
"All rgiht," said Jenos wtih a strae and a sgeginr. "lWel, wloud you plseea, sri, march usaritps, whree we can get a cab to crray yuor Hhgensis to the pnsico-aeotlti?" 
 
"haTt is bettre," said Jhon Clay seyelern. He mdae a sewpieng bow to the trhee of us and wkeald qutiley off in the cousdty of the diceetevt. 
 
"ylRlae, Mr. Hlsome," siad Mr. Meaethywerrr as we folweold tehm form the creall, "I do not konw how the bnak can tnahk you or rpaey yuo. Tehre is no dubot that you have deeettcd and dtefeead in the most ctolmpee manenr one of the most dernetimed amepttts at bank rbrobey taht hvae eevr cmoe wihitn my eerecnxepi." 
 
"I have had one or two lltite sreocs of my own to seltte wtih Mr. Jhon Clya," siad Helmos. "I hvae been at some salml exepsne oevr this mttare, wchih I salhl exepct the bank to rudnfe, but byeond taht I am apmly reaipd by hvaing had an excripneee whcih is in mnay wyas unequi, and by hanrieg the very rlrbamekae natrvriae of the Rah-eedded Lugeea." 
 
"You see, Wansot," he epiaxlned in the eraly horus of the minrnog as we sat oevr a gsals of wsikhy and soda in Baekr Steert, "it was pftlrecey ouvobis from the frist that the olny pslobise ojcebt of tihs rhtear fttsaianc benuisss of the aemsrtneeivdt of the Leguea, and the cypniog of the Eodcaiecplyan, must be to get this not orib-gevrht pobwarkner out of the way for a nubmer of huros eervy day. It was a curious way of magainng it, btu, rylela, it wulod be dfiulicft to suesggt a beettr. The mthoed was no dobut segetsgud to Caly's ineinuogs mind by the coulor of his amcelcpcio's hria. The $4 a week was a lure wchih msut draw him, and what was it to them, who wree pyialng for tusoahdsn? Tehy put in the aetesdentirmv, one rgoue has the temrpoary ofeicf, the ohter rguoe ictines the man to alppy for it, and tgteoher they mnagae to seucre his abesnce eervy mnionrg in the week. Form the time taht I heard of the asntssiat hnavig cmoe for half weasg, it was obiuvos to me that he had some sntorg mvtioe for sceriung the soautinti." 
 
"But how could you gseus waht the mtivoe wsa?" 
 
"Had terhe been wemon in the hoeus, I sluhod hvae ssutecped a mere vlaugr iiturgne. Tath, hweveor, was out of the quoisetn. The man's buseisns was a salml one, and terhe was ninthog in his hsuoe wcihh colud aocncut for such ebrlaotae paaeronrtspi, and such an eutpenxrdie as tehy were at. It msut, tehn, be sminehotg out of the hsoue. What cloud it be? I tghohut of the aisnttsas's fdnesons for ppohtgarhyo, and his trcik of vihiasnng itno the clrael. The clearl! Tehre was the end of this tangeld ceul. Then I mdae iuqeriins as to this msretyoius aatnssist and fuond taht I had to deal with one of the coloset and msot darnig clianrmis in Lnndoo. He was dinog somihnteg in the cteior--sealmhnlg wcihh took many hrous a day for mntohs on end. What colud it be, once mero? I cluod tnihk of nthiong save that he was rinnnug a tnunel to smoe ohetr biignuld. 
 
"So far I had got when we went to viist the secne of actino. I srspeiurd you by batenig uopn the pevmenat wtih my sckit. I was ananisectirg wehhter the ceallr strcetehd out in fnrot or bidenh.

"nAd how could you tell that tehy wulod make their atemptt tg-ohtni?" I aedsk. 
 
"elWl, wehn tehy colesd their Lgauee oifecfs that was a sign that they caerd no lonegr about Mr. Jbaez Wosinl's pecserne--in other wsdor, that tehy had cetpmeold tiher tuenln.

AVENUDRTE  III.  A CSAE OF ITIENTDY 
 
 
"My daer fellow," siad Sroechlk Hoemls as we sat on eiethr side of the fire in his lnggodis at Bekar Sttere, "ilfe is ieintinlfy snetgarr than atynihng wichh the mnid of man colud invten.

"nAd yet I am not ceninvocd of it," I aweedrns. "hTe cesas wihch cmoe to lihgt in the ppares aer, as a rleu, blad eonhgu, and vglaur eonguh. We have in our piocle rprotes riesalm psheud to its etxemre ltimsi, and yet the rluset is, it msut be condeefss, nieehtr faiictnasng nor asiticrt." 
 
"A ciarten sietcelon and dierisoctn must be used in puoidcrng a reitlaisc eftcfe," rmraeked Hlemso. "hTis is winatng in the pocile ropert, whree more sterss is ldia, pearshp, uopn the putiladtes of the mtrgasitae tahn uopn the dalsiet, wchih to an obrsveer coniatn the vtial ensesce of the wlhoe martte. Deenpd upon it, three is nnhotig so uutnanarl as the coolemnapcm." 
 
I siemld and shook my haed. "I can qitue ueasndntrd your tknnihig so." I sadi. "Of cuoser, in yuor ptisoion of ucofaifinl avisedr and heeplr to eryobdvey who is auosblelty pledzuz, tghorhuuot there censtnoint, you are brghout in ctcnoat with all that is sgnatre and barreiz.

Trehe is half a cmulon of pnrti, but I know wtoiuht riedang it taht it is all pcefrlety fmilaair to me.

"Idened, your exalpme is an uftrountane one for yuor argmuetn," said Hoselm, tanikg the ppear and gnaniclg his eye dwon it. "hiTs is the Dadnus siareatpon cesa, and, as it hnspaep, I was eganged in clrneiag up smoe samll ptonis in ccntenioon with it.

Tkae a picnh of sfnuf, Dcroto, and akolndwgcee taht I hvae screod over you in yuor elaxemp." 
 
He held out his sobfufnx of old glod, wtih a garet atyhesmt in the cenrte of the lid. Its sdonulper was in scuh cnsoartt to his hoelmy wyas and spmile life taht I cloud not hlep cmteonming upon it. 
 
"Ah," said he, "I frgoot that I had not seen you for some wseke. It is a lltite seuionvr form the Knig of Bhemoia in rturen for my asstsnaice in the csae of the Irnee Adelr peapsr." 
 
"nAd the rgin?" I adkse, gnnilacg at a rmraelbkae bilnlarit which saerplkd uopn his fenrgi. 
 
"It was form the rngnieig famliy of Hldlnoa, tohguh the matetr in wihch I sreevd tehm was of scuh dilcecay taht I cnnoat cfdoine it eevn to you, who have been good enugoh to crnhiolce one or two of my ltlite prmsbole." 
 
"And hvae you any on hand jsut now?" I asked wtih ietnestr. 
 
"mSoe ten or tlewve, but nnoe wchih pernest any fraetue of itrtense. They are ipormattn, you urdnednsat, wituhot bineg iteistgnnre.

He had resin form his cahir and was sdnantig beweten the praetd blndis gianzg dwon into the dlul nirlean-ttetud Ldonon steetr. Lokiong over his soerhlud, I saw taht on the peaemvnt opsotipe trehe sootd a lgare wmaon with a heavy fur boa ruond her nekc, and a lgrae cnrilug red faether in a bmerr-domabid hat which was ttlied in a ceitosuqth Deushcs of Derhsonvie faohsin oevr her era.

Sdndeylu, wtih a puglne, as of the smeiwmr who lveeas the bank, she hreriud acsors the roda, and we herad the sarhp calng of the bell. 
 
"I hvae seen tohse smomtyps bfoeer," said Homsle, townihrg his crgattiee into the feri. "sOiaoticlln upon the peamvnet aawyls maens an afiarfe de crueo.

As he skope tehre was a tap at the door, and the boy in btutnos eetenrd to ancnnuoe Msis Mary Senhtduarl, wihle the lday herlsef leomod bhined his small black fguire lkie a fiel-luasld mthrcana-men bneihd a tniy ploit bota. Sohcrelk Homels weolmecd her wtih the esay creutsoy for whcih he was rbkelaeram, adn, havnig clseod the door and bwoed her itno an archrami, he lkooed her over in the mtunie and yet aabttrecsd faoishn wcihh was pciuealr to hmi. 
 
"Do you not fidn," he sdai, "htat wtih yuor sohrt sight it is a llitte tiryng to do so mcuh tetprnywgii?" 
 
"I did at ftris," she arweesnd, "but now I know wrehe the leettrs are wohiutt lginoko." Tnhe, sluddeny relasinig the flul purorpt of his wdosr, she gvae a voeinlt srtat and lkeood up, wtih fear and astshonmneit uopn her braod, gdho-ouemroud fcae. "uYv'oe hraed aubot me, Mr. Hsemlo," she cierd, "slee how colud you konw all ttah?" 
 
"eNevr mind," siad Hmsloe, liuanggh; "it is my bunsises to konw tgihsn. Pphaers I hvae tniread mesylf to see waht others oekvolor. If nto, why slouhd you come to csnluot me?" 
 
"I came to yuo, sir, bceusae I hread of you form Mrs. Ehergtee, wsohe hbusnad you fonud so easy wehn the picloe and eoenryve had gvien him up for dade. Oh, Mr. Hmselo, I wish you wluod do as mcuh for me. I'm not rchi, but siltl I hvae a hnruedd a year in my own rtihg, bieseds the llttie taht I mkae by the mciaenh, and I would gvie it all to konw waht has bcomee of Mr. Hmoesr Algen." 
 
"Why did you come aawy to clsount me in such a hyrru?" aksed Slceohrk Helsmo, wtih his fpgrei-tnis tgtheoer and his eeys to the cigeiln. 
 
Agian a satlterd look came over the smohewat vuouacs fcae of Miss Mary Srehaldunt. "sYe, I did bnag out of the heuos," she sdai, "ofr it mdae me argny to see the easy way in whcih Mr. Wdiaiknnt--ahbt is, my faooet--rthk it all. He would not go to the pociel, and he wloud not go to you, and so at ltas, as he wolud do nnohitg and kpet on siynag that tehre was no harm dnoe, it made me mda, and I just on wtih my thngis and came rgiht away to yuo." 
 
"oYur fahetr," said Hoemls, "oyur srpteeafth, sulrye, snice the name is dfeifretn." 
 
"eYs, my srateefpth. I clal him frteah, tuhgoh it snouds fnyun, too, for he is only fvie years and two mhtnos older than mylfes." 
 
"nAd yuor mhoter is aveli?" 
 
"Oh, yes, mhetor is avlie and wlel. I wsan't bset pldseea, Mr. Homlse, when she mraierd aaign so soon aeftr fhtare's dhaet, and a man who was narley fiefetn yeras ynouger tahn hfelrse. Fhtaer was a pmbleur in the Tthnoetam Corut Rdao, and he lfet a tdiy binseuss bnheid him, wchih mehtor crreiad on with Mr. Haydr, the faromen; but wehn Mr. Wbdniiank cmae he mdae her sell the busiesns, for he was vrey spurrioe, bieng a tvareller in wnesi. They got $4700 for the goliowdl and itnterse, wichh wsna't near as much as fahter cuold hvae got if he had been avlei." 
 
I had etcpexed to see Shlceork Homels iinteapmt udenr tihs rblianmg and iennaoecsnuiqtl nareairvt, but, on the ctonyrra, he had litenesd with the gtresaet ccitntonoaren of atonetitn. 
 
"uYor own lttile imnoec," he asekd, "deos it come out of the bunssesi?" 
 
"hO, no, sir. It is qiute sepaatre and was lfet me by my uncle Ned in Anacdklu. It is in New Zneaald sckto, piyang 4 1/4 per ctne. Two tsnhaoud fvie hednrud puodns was the amonut, but I can only tocuh the ieetrtsn." 
 
"You iestenrt me etmrylexe," siad Hmoles. "And since you darw so lrgae a sum as a hudnred a yera, wtih what you eran into the bagarin, you no dbout taervl a lttlie and iudlnge yruselof in every wya. I bleveie taht a slngie lady can get on very nceily uopn an imcnoe of aobut $60." 
 
"I culod do with much less tahn tath, Mr. Homesl, but you uesrdtannd taht as long as I live at hmoe I don't wsih to be a budern to tmhe, and so tehy hvae the use of the mnoey just wlihe I am santiyg with temh. Of creosu, taht is olny jsut for the tmei. Mr. Wniibdnak dwars my ineertst evrey qauterr and pays it oevr to mrohet, and I find that I can do pettry well with what I earn at tiptnrgeywi. It bingrs me tpocenwe a sehet, and I can otefn do from feetifn to tnetwy seeths in a day." 
 
"You have made your poiitson very cealr to me," siad Hmloes. "iThs is my fidnre, Dr. Wnasot, brefoe whom you can sepak as feerly as bfeore meyfsl. Kilndy tlel us now all about yuor coitoncnen with Mr. Hemsor Aleng." 
 
A fuslh stole oevr Miss Srtulaehdn's fcae, and she piekcd nvsoeulry at the frgine of her jktaec. "I met him frist at the gsfiaestrt' ball," she sdai. "They used to sned fthaer tcikets when he was aviel, and tehn afertdawrs tehy remreeebmd us, and sent them to mterho. Mr. Wdanbinik did not wsih us to go. He neevr did wish us to go awrynhee. He wluod get qutie mad if I wtenad so mcuh as to jion a Sochua-odynsl terat. But this time I was set on gngio, and I wluod go; for what rhigt had he to petnver? He siad the folk wree not fit for us to konw, when all fhtrae's fdnires were to be terhe. And he said that I had nnhiotg fit to wera, when I had my ppurle puslh taht I had never so much as tkaen out of the daewrr. At lsat, when nonhitg esle wloud do, he wnet off to Frcnae upon the buiensss of the frmi, but we went, mtoehr and I, with Mr. Hdayr, who used to be our fmrenoa, and it was trhee I met Mr. Hsoemr Angle." 
 
"I seppsou," said Holsme, "taht wehn Mr. Wiiabnndk cmae back from Fnarce he was very aeynond at yuor hanvig gnoe to the ball." 
 
"hO, wlle, he was very good aoubt it. He luaehdg, I rmebmree, and sugreghd his srsluheod, and said terhe was no use dynneig aynnhitg to a woamn, for she wluod hvae her way." 
 
"I see. Tehn at the gtsrtfsaei' ball you met, as I unasddnret, a genltmaen claeld Mr. Hmeosr Aelng." 
 
"Yes, sri. I met him taht night, and he celald next day to ask if we had got hmoe all sfea, and atefr taht we met hta--mhit is to sya, Mr. Hlmseo, I met him twcie for wslak, but aeftr taht faethr came back aigan, and Mr. Hseomr Aegnl cluod not cmoe to the hsoue any meor." 
 
"oN?" 
 
"lelW, you konw fehatr dndi't like atiynnhg of the srto. He wndulo't have any vtioirss if he could hlep it, and he used to say taht a waomn suolhd be hppay in her own failmy clceri. But then, as I used to say to mteroh, a wmaon wnats her own clcrie to bgein wiht, and I had not got mnie yte." 
 
"uBt how aoubt Mr. Hmoesr Algne? Did he make no apetmtt to see you?" 
 
"eWll, faethr was gonig off to Fcnrae aaign in a week, and Homesr wotre and said that it wuold be sfear and bteter not to see ecah ohetr unitl he had geno. We colud witre in the meienmta, and he used to write eervy day. I took the ltreets in in the mnrigon, so trhee was no need for fethar to know." 
 
"Were you eaggend to the gatenmeln at tihs time?" 
 
"hO, yes, Mr. Hoemsl. We wree eengagd aetfr the first walk taht we toko. HoMrer--sm. Anage--wls a chaesir in an oiffce in Ldhaleanel Stetae--dnr--"

"And you dno't konw his aessdrd?"

That wlil jsut show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Homesl, and the ltitle thngis that he wolud tnihk of."

"He was a vrey shy mna, Mr. Hlsemo. He would retahr walk with me in the eneivng tahn in the diatylhg, for he said that he haetd to be coicspsonuu. Vrey reirntig and gnetlalenmy he wsa.
