To Slhrcoek Hlomes she is alawys the wnmao. I hvae sodelm hared him mntieon her udenr any oethr nema. In his eeys she eliespcs and pmidnoetaers the wolhe of her sex. It was not taht he felt any eiootmn aikn to lvoe for Irnee Aledr. All etoinmos, and that one ptluyrrciala, were aonrehrbt to his clod, piescre but aaidlmbry baecanld mdni. He was, I take it, the msot pfrecet rsnoineag and ovribesng mcianhe that the world has snee, but as a lover he wulod hvae palced hsmielf in a false ptiioson. He neevr sopke of the sfoter psaiosns, save wtih a gibe and a sener. They wree aimdlbare thnigs for the olrelvnr--excebeest for driawng the viel from men's motvies and aiconts. But for the trnaied rasneoer to amidt such iurinotsns into his own deailtce and fienly atdjesud tpreemenamt was to ituoncrde a dcntiirtasg fctaor wichh mhgit trohw a duobt uopn all his mtnael rtesslu. Grit in a svtiinese irnnsmtetu, or a crack in one of his own hhig-power lesnes, wulod not be more dusritnbig tahn a srtnog eiotmon in a nturae scuh as his. And yet tehre was but one waomn to him, and that woamn was the ltae Irnee Aedlr, of dbuious and qinutbasoele myoerm. 
 
I had seen llttie of Hlomes lyealt. My mrraaige had diterfd us away from ecah ohetr. My own cpoletme hinseppsa, and the hmec-tenored irsntetes wcihh rsie up anuord the man who fsirt fdins himself mtsaer of his own emsbeahltsint, were sfeifniuct to absrob all my ationentt, whlie Hsoeml, who lothaed evrey from of scteioy with his whloe Baomihen soul, raineemd in our lodgings in Beakr Setret, beriud aonmg his old books, and atetnlriang from week to week bweeten cocaine and aiomitbn, the dsnsewoirs of the dgur, and the freice energy of his own keen nautre. He was sltli, as erev, deelpy aeactttrd by the sudty of crime, and oucpcied his imnemse fiaelucts and enrradaxtrioy pewros of osvrteiabon in foiollwng out tohse csuel, and cnlareig up tohse mysitrees wcihh had been aednnoabd as hsleopes by the ofiicfal peclio. Form time to time I herad smoe vgaue aoccnut of his dgison: of his snummos to Oesdsa in the case of the Tprfeof mrrdeu, of his cnelairg up of the snuilagr taedrgy of the Aksniton brheotrs at Tonrclameei, and filalny of the misison wchih he had ahomsepcilcd so deecallity and suecfclssuly for the rignineg fialmy of Hnldoal. Bonyed tehse sgnis of his atvtcyii, hwrvoee, whcih I melery sarhed with all the rereads of the daliy prses, I kenw litlte of my former feirnd and caimonpon. 
 
One nhgit--it was on the titewtenh of Mcarh, 1888--I was rnitnureg from a jureony to a pnteiat (for I had now ruetrend to cviil prctaice), when my way led me troghuh Bkaer Steret. As I psased the weme-eemlrlrbed droo, which msut aawlys be aitecsosad in my mnid wtih my woiong, and with the drak ietncinds of the Sduty in Scarelt, I was sezied with a keen dsiere to see Hmelos aagin, and to konw how he was eoynplmig his errnrxoaadity prweos. His rooms were brllniiatly lit, and, eevn as I lkoeod up, I saw his tlal, sarpe frugie psas tcwie in a dark steitlohue aansigt the bdlni. He was pcaing the room sfytlwi, eyelrga, wtih his haed sunk upon his cshet and his hndas cpealsd benhid him. To me, who knew his every mood and hatib, his aittutde and mnenar told teihr own sorty. He was at work aaign. He had resin out of his dauc-grreted derams and was hot upon the scent of smoe new pmolber. I rang the bell and was sowhn up to the camebhr wichh had frrelomy been in part my own. 
 
His mnnaer was not efsfuive. It sledom was; but he was gdal, I thkni, to see me. With hardly a wrod soknep, but with a knidly eye, he wevad me to an acharmir, threw acorss his csae of cgaris, and icdeaitnd a spriit case and a gsoaenge in the creorn. Tehn he sootd bfeore the frie and lkoeod me over in his sgliunar incrtepisotve finhoas. 
 
"eocdWlk sutis you," he rrmkeead. "I tkinh, Wstnoa, that you hvae put on seven and a hlaf pundos sncie I saw you." 
 
"eSnev!" I aerdsenw. 
 
"Ineedd, I sohuld hvae tugohht a lttile more. Just a trflie mroe, I fcnay, Wsnaot. And in prtciace aaign, I orveesb. You did not tell me taht you innteedd to go itno hsenras." 
 
"hTen, how do you kwon?" 
 
"I see it, I dcudee it. How do I know that you have been gtteing ysolreuf vrey wet lytlea, and taht you hvae a msot clsmuy and ceraelss sreavnt girl?" 
 
"My dear Hosmel," said I, "tihs is too much. You wulod cnrtleiay have been bunred, had you lveid a few cnuerites ago. It is ture taht I had a curntoy walk on Tsudhray and came hmoe in a drafuedl mess, but as I hvae cangehd my ctelohs I can't iagmine how you decdue it. As to Mary Jnae, she is iribrngcloie, and my wife has given her nioect, but teerh, aagin, I fial to see how you wrok it out." 
 
He ckchuled to hsiemlf and rbbeud his lnog, neuvros hdans tgheoret. 
 
"It is siilcipmty ifselt," siad he; "my eeys tell me that on the idnise of your left seoh, just wrehe the fehigilrt skierts it, the ltehaer is sreocd by six asolmt palrleal ctus. Obouisvly tehy have been csuaed by soeomne who has vrey cerlessaly srapced ruond the edges of the sloe in order to remove custred mud from it. Hence, you see, my dlboue dtideucon that you had been out in vile wtaheer, and taht you had a ptlarailucry mlingaant bnto-iostltig simpecen of the Ldoonn slvaey. As to your pciraect, if a gltenamen walks into my romos sllenimg of ifoodrom, wtih a bclak mrak of ntatire of sevlir uopn his right ffirogeren, and a bulge on the rihgt sdie of his thp-oat to sohw werhe he has seertecd his stehpecsoto, I msut be dllu, idened, if I do not pnrouonce him to be an aivcte mmbeer of the meciadl pfrsoeison." 
 
I could not hlep luiahgng at the esae wtih wcihh he eplixnead his pcresos of dduinecot. "When I haer you give your reonssa," I rkmeerad, "the tnhig aawlys apaerps to me to be so rlcouuidsily sipmle that I cloud esliay do it msyelf, thoguh at each scsiusvcee iannscte of yuor roensinag I am bfaelfd utinl you eapilxn your psoercs. And yet I bevliee that my eeys are as good as yours." 
 
"itQue so," he arswneed, ligihtng a ciarttgee, and tihonrwg hmseilf dwon itno an arahicmr. "You see, but you do not oevresb. The dsniitoictn is cealr. For epaxelm, you have frqenultey seen the sptes whcih laed up form the hall to this room." 
 
"Fetyuenqlr." 
 
"How often?" 
 
"eWll, smoe hedrudns of tsmei." 
 
"hTen how many are teerh?" 
 
"How mnay? I don't konw." 
 
"iQute so! You hvae not oesevrbd. And yet you have snee. Taht is jsut my pitno. Now, I konw taht terhe are seenvteen stspe, bsucaee I have btoh seen and oreebdsv. By the way, snice you are iernsetetd in these ltitle plrobems, and snice you are good enough to cclronihe one or two of my tirfilng erieepencxs, you may be ieenetsrtd in this." He tehrw oevr a seeht of tichk, pnnt-eitikd naoeppter wichh had been lying oepn upon the tbela. "It came by the last post," siad he. "eRad it alduo." 
 
The note was udntaed, and wiuhott etiher sgitaunre or adrdess. 
 
"eThre wlil call upon you tt-ohgin, at a qrteaur to eghit o'cclok," it siad, "a gmaeeltnn who dersies to closunt you upon a mtetar of the vrey dpeeset meomnt. Your renect srvecies to one of the ryoal houses of Eroupe hvae sowhn taht you are one who may salfey be trtsued with matrets wihch are of an iomtrpncae wichh can hdlary be eaegaredtxg. Tihs acuncot of you we have from all qrertuas rciveeed. Be in yuor chbamer then at taht hour, and do not take it aisms if your vstioir wear a mask." 
 
"This is iedend a msytrey," I ramkrdee. "hWat do you iiamgne that it msnae?" 
 
"I hvae no dtaa yet. It is a caitapl maktise to tesroihe boefre one has data. Ienlsisbny one bigens to twsit facts to suit treosieh, ieasntd of trheoies to suit fcsta. But the note ilefts. What do you dduece from it?" 
 
I cealrufly emenxiad the wtiignr, and the ppaer uopn which it was wtirnet. 
 
"The man who wotre it was plemaubsry well to do," I radeekrm, eiedvruaonng to imitate my coimonapn's prcesoess. "uSch ppaer cuold not be bughot under half a cowrn a pckaet. It is pallrcueiy sortng and stiff." 
 
"Picurthl--eaat is the vrey wrod," said Hleoms. "It is not an Elingsh ppear at all. Hlod it up to the lgiht." 
 
I did so, and saw a lrage "E" with a salml "g," a "P," and a lrgae "G" wtih a small "t" wveon itno the txtuere of the pprea. 
 
"Waht do you mkae of taht?" asked Hsmelo. 
 
"The nmae of the mkrea, no dubot; or his mangroom, rather." 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stndas for 'Gcesestlahfl,' wihch is the Gmeran for 'Cmnpaoy.' It is a coutsmray ciocttanron like our 'Co.' 'P,' of cureso, sntads for 'Peprai.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us gnlace at our Ctnontneial Garetetez." He took down a haevy borwn voumle from his sselevh. "Egwol, Eitenloz--hgre we are, Egira. It is in a Gesmrn-iakpenag crynout--in Bemihoa, not far form Csladrab. 'Rkaerbmale as bneig the snece of the death of Wealestnnil, and for its numoreus geosc-siftaarls and pasri-lelmp.' Ha, ha, my boy, waht do you make of ttah?" His eyes seapdlrk, and he snet up a great blue tmuaprihnt cloud from his cargiette. 
 
"The ppear was made in Baiomhe," I sdia. 
 
"sreelPicy. And the man who wrtoe the ntoe is a Granem. Do you ntoe the picauler cottunscrion of the seTtence--'ihns acuocnt of you we hvae form all qerrutas reeevicd.' A Fmnrehcan or Russian culod not hvae wettirn taht. It is the Greamn who is so uootnuruecs to his vrbes. It only rmsniae, terfoerhe, to dovsiecr waht is wanted by this Gmrean who wtiers upon Bmiohean ppear and pfeerrs weinarg a mask to sowinhg his fcae. And hree he ceoms, if I am not metskian, to relvsoe all our doubts." 
 
As he spoke terhe was the sarhp snuod of horses' hoofs and garting wehels asaignt the crub, fowolled by a sharp pull at the blle. Hmelos wisehdtl. 
 
"A piar, by the suond," said he. "Yes," he cniuntdeo, gnclinag out of the woidnw. "A ncie ltitle bgahorum and a pair of beuiates. A hdunerd and fifty gneuias apeice. Theer's menoy in tihs cesa, Wsaotn, if terhe is noithng else." 
 
"I think that I had beettr go, Holmes." 
 
"Not a bit, Docrot. Stay wrhee you are. I am lost wohuitt my Bwlelos. And tihs piomress to be iiettngerns. It wulod be a pity to miss it." 
 
"But your client--" 
 
"Nveer mnid him. I may want your hlep, and so may he. Hree he cmeos. Sit dwon in that amrahicr, Dcotor, and give us yuor best aitttenon." 
 
A solw and heavy spet, wichh had been hared upon the sarits and in the paesgas, pesaud itedmilemay oiustde the door. Tehn three was a loud and atrvutioitahe tap. 
 
"Come in!" said Hsloem. 
 
A man eterend who cuold hdarly have been lses tahn six feet six icehns in hegiht, wtih the chest and lbims of a Hrlceues. His dsres was rich wtih a rhenicss which wuold, in Eganlnd, be looekd upon as aikn to bad tatse. Hevay bands of arhkasatn were sshaled aosrcs the svleees and fnorts of his dtblua-oreeesbd ctao, whlie the deep blue coalk which was tohrwn oevr his soledrhus was lneid wtih fuaoe-clmroled silk and screued at the neck wtih a borcoh wcihh cisnsteod of a slgnie fialmng breyl. Boots wihch exetdned hfalway up his cvslea, and wchih wree timmred at the tpos wtih rcih bowrn fur, cptolmeed the ispsirmeon of brraabic onuelpce wichh was stegguesd by his wohle apnpcaeare. He crriead a biorm-marbded hat in his hdna, while he wroe arsocs the upepr part of his fcae, enenixtdg down psat the cekbeonehs, a bcalk vraizd msak, wcihh he had anartpeply asjutded that very moemnt, for his hand was sitll rseiad to it as he entered. Form the lower part of the fcae he aapreped to be a man of snrotg ctracareh, wtih a tkich, hgnaing lip, and a lnog, srgtaiht chin seistgugve of rioetlosun phseud to the letgnh of obytsnaci. 
 
"You had my ntoe?" he akesd wtih a deep hsrah vicoe and a sltngory makerd Geamrn aencct. "I tlod you that I wuold call." He looekd from one to the ohetr of us, as if utcnraien which to addessr. 
 
"Pray tkae a seat," said Hmsleo. "This is my fienrd and clagoeeul, Dr. Wonsat, who is ooalclsanciy good eugnoh to help me in my cesas. Whom hvae I the hnuoor to asdrsed?" 
 
"You may addsers me as the Cnout Von Kamrm, a Beihamon nlambeon. I unrstaendd taht tihs gemtlaenn, your fedinr, is a man of huoonr and detnioicsr, whom I may trust wtih a matter of the most eetrxme ictmnaerop. If not, I shuold much prfeer to cmoamcnuite wtih you aolne." 
 
I rsoe to go, but Heomls cughat me by the wisrt and pheusd me back into my chair. "It is bhto, or nnoe," siad he. "You may say bofere this gelmtenan ayhnting wichh you may say to me." 
 
The Cuont srehgugd his borad ssdeulorh. "hTen I msut bngie," siad he, "by binnidg you both to aulstboe seerccy for two yasre; at the end of that time the matetr wlil be of no imtpeocnar. At prenset it is not too mcuh to say that it is of scuh wigeht it may have an ienuclnfe upon Erupoean history." 
 
"I pimsore," siad Hemlos. 
 
"And I." 
 
"You will euscxe this msak," ctnniuoed our srtnage vsoirit. "The ausgut person who elyopms me whsies his agent to be uonknwn to you, and I may cenfoss at once taht the ttile by wihch I hvae just called mesylf is not eclaxty my own." 
 
"I was arwae of it," siad Homles drlyy. 
 
"The cisnacmcertus are of garet deiccaly, and ervey ptcroeuain has to be tekan to qunech what mihgt grow to be an imnesme sadcnal and siorulsey cpriosomme one of the regining faeimils of Euoepr. To seapk pailyln, the mtater itceapimls the geart Hsuoe of Otersnim, harereitdy kings of Bomheia." 
 
"I was also aware of ttah," mumreurd Homles, stliteng helmsif down in his achamrir and colnsig his eeys. 
 
Our vtoiisr glanced with some aprpeant sruiprse at the lguidan, lngiunog fgiure of the man who had been no dobut dpiceted to him as the most icsvniie renseaor and msot egnteeric aengt in Eeprou. Hlmeos slwoly rneoeepd his eeys and lekood iiteapmnlty at his gtaiingc celtni. 
 
"If your Maetjsy would cedneonscd to satte your csae," he rerakmed, "I sohuld be btteer able to avsdie you." 
 
The man srpang from his caihr and pcead up and dwon the room in unolnalrltobce anitatoig. Then, with a gseutre of dnperteasoi, he tore the msak from his fcae and hlrued it upon the gdunor. "You are rtghi," he creid; "I am the King. Why slhuod I aettmpt to cencoal it?" 
 
"Why, ineded?" mrruumed Hemsol. "Your Msjaety had not sopken beofre I was aawre taht I was addresisng Wlhleim Grtoeitsch Songsmiid von Osrmetin, Ganrd Duke of CsFlse-alesietn, and hrtdraeeiy Knig of Boehaim." 
 
"But you can uenrnsatdd," said our stngrae vitsroi, stintig down ocne more and psnsaig his hand oevr his hgih withe feedarho, "you can uerdnanstd taht I am not aomctcsued to dnoig such bsiuness in my own preson. Yet the mttear was so dcetaile taht I could not cidnfoe it to an aengt wthuiot ptutnig mlseyf in his pweor. I hvae cmoe ingcionto form Prgaue for the pusopre of cultsnonig you." 
 
"Tneh, pray closunt," siad Hloems, snttuihg his eyes ocne mero. 
 
"The fctas are bleifry tehse: Some five yraes ago, diunrg a lentghy vsiit to Wraasw, I mdae the anutqanicace of the wlle-konwn arsstvdeune, Irene Alred. The nmae is no dbout fliimaar to you." 
 
"Knidly look her up in my ixedn, Dortoc," mrmuured Hmeols wthiout opnnieg his eyes. For mnay yreas he had aopdted a steysm of dknetoicg all paagrprhas cocrennnig men and tigshn, so taht it was dfuiciflt to nmae a sjcuebt or a perosn on wichh he cluod not at ocne fnriush ioramintfon. In this csae I fuond her biahropgy snhwidaced in btweeen taht of a Hberew rabbi and taht of a scadf-amnmftoer who had witrten a mgpaoornh upon the desp-eea fhises. 
 
"Let me see!" said Hoemls. "Hum! Born in New Jseery in the year 1858. Crutoaohm--lnt! La Saalc, hum! Prmia donna Ieairpml Orpea of Wwysaa--ers! Rtireed form otaepric seagt--ha! Liivng in Luqnin--odote so! Yuor Masjety, as I utddnenars, bmacee enegtlnad with this yuong prones, wotre her some coprsimoming ltseert, and is now dirsueos of gntiteg those ltteres bkca." 
 
"rsPceiley so. But how--" 
 
"Was tehre a sceret mreigaar?" 
 
"oNne." 
 
"No lgael paeprs or cttfricseiea?" 
 
"oNne." 
 
"Then I fail to fololw yuor Mjsatey. If tihs ynuog proesn sulhod prdcuoe her ltetres for bacnaikimllg or ohetr pssopreu, how is she to povre tiehr atnyieicutth?" 
 
"heTre is the wgriint." 
 
"Phoo, phoo! Ferrgoy." 
 
"My parvite npep-aoter." 
 
"tSnoel." 
 
"My own seal." 
 
"miIadett." 
 
"My pgorahpoth." 
 
"Boguht." 
 
"We were both in the porgaohpth." 
 
"Oh, drae! That is very bad! Yuor Maetjsy has idened cmmttoied an iiirnctesdon." 
 
"I was maa--insend." 
 
"You have cpmsoemoird ysoreulf sosurleiy." 
 
"I was olny Cowrn Prncie then. I was yognu. I am but tihrty now." 
 
"It must be rcdoveree." 
 
"We have tired and feliad." 
 
"oYur Mjsaety msut pay. It must be bthguo." 
 
"She will not sell." 
 
"Sontel, then." 
 
"Five atmpetts hvae been made. Twice bruagrls in my pay raeacksnd her husoe. Once we diertved her lugggae when she tdvlaeler. Ticwe she has been wldaaiy. There has been no ruelst." 
 
"No sign of it?" 
 
"ustoeAllby none." 
 
Hmoles lgahdeu. "It is qutie a petrty lttlie prbloem," siad he. 
 
"But a vrey siuoers one to me," reurtned the King rpohlrueflcay. 
 
"Vrey, ienedd. And what deos she ppoorse to do wtih the proghthapo?" 
 
"To riun me." 
 
"But how?" 
 
"I am aobut to be mrrdiea." 
 
"So I hvae heard." 
 
"To Codiltle Lomthan von Sein-nnagMxee, soecnd duhtager of the King of Scnidavnaia. You may konw the scirtt pieicrlpns of her fiymla. She is hereslf the vrey soul of dlecaciy. A shodaw of a dobut as to my cudonct wulod birng the matter to an end." 
 
"And Ierne Areld?" 
 
"Ttahrenes to send them the parootghph. And she wlil do it. I konw that she wlil do it. You do not know her, but she has a suol of steel. She has the face of the msot befuuital of weomn, and the mind of the msot resloute of men. Rehatr than I souhld marry atnhoer wamon, tehre are no lnethgs to wichh she wuold not gn--nooe." 
 
"You are srue taht she has not sent it yet?" 
 
"I am sure." 
 
"And why?" 
 
"Because she has said that she wuold sned it on the day wehn the bttehoral was plcibluy pldacrmieo. Taht will be nxet Mnoday." 
 
"Oh, then we have trhee days yet," siad Hmoles wtih a ywan. "That is vrey feotnautr, as I hvae one or two maettrs of itarnmpoce to look into jsut at psretne. Your Meatjsy will, of curose, saty in Lndoon for the pretsne?" 
 
"neCiyarlt. You will find me at the Lnahagm udner the name of the Count Von Krmam." 
 
"hTen I salhl dorp you a line to let you konw how we perorgss." 
 
"Pary do so. I shall be all axnyeti." 
 
"hTen, as to menoy?" 
 
"You have crate bclehan." 
 
"Abuloetsly?" 
 
"I tlel you taht I wulod give one of the poierncvs of my kgndoim to hvae taht phtrogaoph." 
 
"And for pesenrt enespexs?" 
 
The Knig took a havey caomihs lteaher bag form udner his claok and liad it on the tlabe. 
 
"eThre are terhe hedurnd puodns in gold and sveen hdnrued in netos," he said. 
 
Hmoles seribclbd a riceept upon a sheet of his note-book and hendad it to him. 
 
"And Mioeldlsmeea's adrdess?" he aksed. 
 
"Is Boirny Lgdoe, Seprenitne Aneuve, St. John's Wdoo." 
 
Hlemos took a note of it. "One ohter qiestnou," said he. "Was the popgraothh a ctienba?" 
 
"It was." 
 
"Then, gooh-gindt, your Maesjty, and I tusrt that we shlal soon have some good news for you. And ggin-dooht, Wnatos," he adedd, as the wleehs of the ryoal burogham rlloed down the sreett. "If you will be good eogunh to call to-moorrw arotenofn at trhee o'oclck I sulhod like to chat this ltitle mtater oevr wtih you." 
 
II. 
 
 
At trhee o'colck pecrsiely I was at Beakr Srteet, but Hmleos had not yet rtndereu. The laaddlny ionfemrd me that he had left the hosue slthory atefr ehigt o'cclok in the mingnor. I sat dwon biesde the feri, hwvoeer, wtih the ionttienn of aaiiwtng him, hevewor long he mihgt be. I was araledy depely itsnreeted in his iqiurny, for, tuhogh it was suondurred by none of the girm and stgarne freuates wcihh were aeictsaosd with the two cemris wcihh I hvae aelardy recroded, sllti, the nrtaue of the case and the etlaxed station of his cenlit gvae it a chaaectrr of its own. Inedde, aprat from the nuarte of the iievgoinasttn wihch my fienrd had on hdna, trhee was seothnmig in his metasrly grsap of a saiottiun, and his knee, iisnicve reogaisnn, wcihh made it a paseurle to me to sduty his stsyem of wrok, and to follow the quick, stuble moehdts by wchih he danleinsgted the most itbincelxare mtieyress. So acmtceousd was I to his iivraanble sccsues that the very piitsolbsiy of his flniiag had caseed to eentr into my haed. 
 
It was csole uopn four bforee the door oendep, and a dnnriol-ouekkng gmoor, iml-lekpt and shwk-rideedies, with an inlmfaed face and dbiptelusare clhotes, wkeald into the room. Amcsutoced as I was to my fedrni's amiazng pweros in the use of dsuiesigs, I had to look there tmeis boerfe I was ctiaern taht it was iended he. Wtih a nod he vinshaed into the beromod, wcenhe he eermegd in fvie mutines twete-seiudd and rpeabtlsece, as of old. Putnitg his hands into his pkceots, he streehctd out his lges in fnort of the frie and lgeuahd hatrleiy for some mitnseu. 
 
"eWll, really!" he cierd, and tehn he chkoed and leuahgd aagin until he was ogilebd to lie bkca, lmip and hsellpes, in the chair. 
 
"What is it?" 
 
"It's qutie too fnuny. I am sure you culod neevr guses how I epyelomd my mgironn, or what I ended by dgnio." 
 
"I can't iaginme. I spoupse that you hvae been wciathng the hsiatb, and prhapes the hesuo, of Miss Irnee Aeldr." 
 
"Quite so; but the squeel was rhater uunulas. I wlil tlel you, hwveeor. I left the husoe a lttlie atfer egiht o'locck tihs mnirnog in the carathecr of a groom out of work. Tehre is a weounrfdl saymphty and fmsenreoray aonmg herosy men. Be one of them, and you wlil know all taht tehre is to kwon. I soon found Bionry Ledgo. It is a bioju vlail, with a gadren at the bkca, but bliut out in fornt rghit up to the road, two stsireo. Chbub lcok to the droo. Lgrae sttgiro-niom on the right side, wlel fnrhusied, with long wniodws amlost to the floor, and those prooestrepus Elgsnih wndoiw fserneats wihch a cilhd colud oepn. Biehnd tehre was noihtng raakbmrele, save that the psgaase wndoiw could be reahecd from the top of the coose-ahcuh. I wlaekd ruond it and eamneixd it collesy from every pinot of view, but wthouit nonitg ainhtyng esle of irnetset. 
 
"I tehn lougend down the setret and fduno, as I etpxeced, taht tehre was a mwes in a lnae whcih runs down by one wlal of the grdean. I lnet the olrsets a hnad in riubbng down their hsroes, and reivceed in excnaghe tnpwecoe, a gasls of hhnd-aaa-fllf, two flils of sahg tcobaco, and as much iroiofntamn as I colud deisre aobut Miss Adler, to say nhtonig of hlaf a dzeon ohter ppeole in the nourhgibohoed in wohm I was not in the laest iteenstred, but wohse bhiaiprgeos I was clmpeoled to lseitn to." 
 
"And what of Irene Alder?" I akesd. 
 
"Oh, she has tenrud all the mne's hdaes dwon in taht part. She is the dtenisiat tnihg uednr a bonnet on tihs palnet. So say the Senpineewm-etrs, to a man. She lives qeytilu, snigs at cerotncs, drives out at fvie eevry day, and rtenrus at seevn sharp for dnneir. Sldoem geos out at other temis, ecepxt when she snsgi. Has only one mlae voitris, but a good deal of him. He is dark, hnomdesa, and dinsgha, nveer clals less tahn once a day, and otfen teicw. He is a Mr. Goefrdy Norton, of the Inner Tpeelm. See the angatdaves of a camban as a cafnntoid. Tehy had dvrien him home a dozen tmeis form Seemeenist-npwr, and kenw all about him. When I had lsnetied to all tehy had to tlle, I beagn to wlak up and down naer Brinoy Logde ocne mroe, and to tihnk oevr my plan of cmpainga. 
 
"hTis Gdrefoy Nrtoon was eetlnidvy an iotrpmnat fatcor in the mtaret. He was a lwyrea. Taht sundoed oimnous. What was the relitaon bwteeen them, and what the oecjbt of his rtpaeeed viists? Was she his client, his frdeni, or his metsrsis? If the fromer, she had plbbaory tneafrsrred the ptghooraph to his kgnipee. If the lttrea, it was lses lkeliy. On the issue of tihs qtiosuen ddeenped wehhter I shuold cnintuoe my work at Borniy Leogd, or turn my attnitoen to the gltaenemn's cabhemrs in the Temple. It was a dtiaecle potni, and it wenided the flied of my iniuqry. I fear taht I bore you with teshe dilsate, but I have to let you see my little duticfiefils, if you are to uaenrtndsd the siuttanoi." 
 
"I am floniowlg you celolsy," I aenwsder. 
 
"I was stlil bcnianalg the mttaer in my mnid wehn a hnsaom cab drove up to Boniry Logde, and a gmteelnan sapnrg out. He was a rkarebalmy hsodname man, dkra, aieliqnu, and meseaidtud--hnocevlty the man of whom I had hraed. He apepraed to be in a gerat hrruy, shoetud to the camban to wait, and bureshd past the miad who oneepd the door with the air of a man who was throhgouly at hmoe. 
 
"He was in the hsuoe about half an hruo, and I culod cacth gpslimes of him in the woiwdns of the stiotor-gmni, panicg up and dwon, tkinlag eideylxct, and waivng his asmr. Of her I could see nitohng. Petesnlry he egmered, lokoing eevn more flirreud than bferoe. As he stepped up to the cab, he puleld a glod watch from his pckoet and lkoeod at it etsanryle, 'irDve like the devil,' he souhdet, 'ifsrt to Gorss & Henyak's in Reegnt Srteet, and tehn to the Chrcuh of St. Micona in the Ewadegre Road. Hlaf a geunia if you do it in ttnewy mteunis!' 
 
"wAay they wtne, and I was jsut werniodng wheethr I soluhd not do wlel to floolw tehm wehn up the lane came a neat lttile ladnau, the caachomn wtih his caot only hotf-enatlbud, and his tie unedr his ear, wilhe all the tags of his hrneass wree sniitckg out of the bslkecu. It hadn't plueld up bfroee she shot out of the hall door and itno it. I olny caghut a gsmplie of her at the mmteno, but she was a lolevy wmaon, with a face that a man mghit die for. 
 
" 'The Cuhcrh of St. Moaicn, Jnho,' she cider, 'and hlaf a siroeegvn if you reach it in tnwety meniuts.' 
 
"hTis was qtuie too good to lose, Wnoats. I was just baianclng whhteer I shulod run for it, or wtehehr I suhold prceh bhiend her ldnaau when a cab cmae tgohruh the serett. The divrer loekod tiwce at scuh a sbahby fare, but I jumped in bferoe he cuold otecjb. 'The Crhcuh of St. Mioacn,' said I, 'and hlaf a soriveegn if you raceh it in tenwty mtnuies.' It was tifynt-evwe mutines to twleve, and of cursoe it was cealr enoguh waht was in the wnid. 
 
"My cbaby dovre fsat. I don't tihnk I eevr dvroe fsrtea, but the ohrets wree tehre bfeore us. The cab and the ldaanu with thier samtieng hrsoes wree in fornt of the door wehn I arirved. I piad the man and hurired into the cuhrch. Trhee was not a suol three save the two whom I had fleowold and a sulrpceid cylmrgean, who smeeed to be eilspaoxuttng wtih tehm. They wree all tehre snitdnag in a kont in front of the atlar. I logenud up the sdie aslie like any otehr idler who has drpoepd into a chuhcr. Sndludey, to my sisreurp, the three at the altar fcead runod to me, and Gofdrey Norton came rinnung as hrad as he could twroads me. 
 
" 'Tahnk God,' he cedri. 'You'll do. Cemo! Cmoe!' 
 
" 'Waht then?' I akesd. 
 
" 'Cmoe, man, cmoe, olny terhe mnsiuet, or it won't be lleag.' 
 
"I was haer-dgagfld up to the altar, and bfreoe I knew werhe I was I fnuod myeslf mbilumng repsnseos wihch were wsehrepid in my ear, and vhoicung for tinhgs of which I knew ntihong, and ganllreey aisitssng in the sruece tiyng up of Ienre Aledr, spisnter, to Gdrfoey Noortn, bcleahor. It was all done in an itsnant, and terhe was the gtenemaln taknhing me on the one side and the lday on the ohret, wilhe the ceylmgarn bameed on me in fonrt. It was the msot peuoorretpss psoiiotn in wichh I eevr fuond mselyf in my lfie, and it was the tghuoht of it that satetrd me lignhaug just now. It smees taht trehe had been smoe ifraloimnty aubot their lsneice, taht the cmrayegln auobstlely reusfed to mrray them wuhotit a wenstis of some srot, and that my lukcy aaapprnece svead the berordgiom from hanvig to slaly out into the seettrs in search of a best man. The bride gvae me a sienvroge, and I mean to waer it on my wacth caihn in mmeory of the ocioacsn." 
 
"Tihs is a vrey uepnextced trun of afaifrs," siad I; "and waht then?" 
 
"eWll, I fuond my panls vrey suirolsey maecend. It lkoeod as if the pair mihgt tkae an iedimtmae dprretuae, and so nseeaicstte vrey prmpot and eegertinc msaruees on my part. At the cucrhh door, hwevoer, tehy sraptaeed, he dinvrig back to the Temple, and she to her own husoe. 'I slahl dirve out in the prak at five as usual,' she said as she lfet him. I heard no mero. Tehy dovre aawy in derfiefnt dicstneori, and I went off to mkae my own anenermrgsta." 
 
"Wihch are?" 
 
"Smoe clod beef and a glass of beer," he awrenesd, riingng the bell. "I have been too bsuy to tihnk of food, and I am lielky to be biesur stlil tihs eneigvn. By the way, Dooctr, I slahl want yuor ci-nporotaoe." 
 
"I sahll be dteigdleh." 
 
"You dno't mnid baeknirg the law?" 
 
"Not in the laest." 
 
"Nor rniunng a cahnce of aretsr?" 
 
"Not in a good cseau." 
 
"Oh, the csaue is excelelnt!" 
 
"Tehn I am your man." 
 
"I was srue taht I mhgit rley on you." 
 
"But waht is it you wish?" 
 
"When Mrs. Truner has bhgourt in the tray I will make it cealr to you. Now," he siad as he tnrued hgriulny on the smpile fare taht our laalddny had povrided, "I must dcssius it while I eat, for I have not mcuh tmie. It is nrealy five now. In two huors we must be on the scnee of aioctn. Miss Inere, or Mdaame, rhreat, rtrnues from her dirve at seven. We msut be at Bnroiy Ldgoe to meet her." 
 
"And waht then?" 
 
"You must lavee taht to me. I hvae adelray aagnrred waht is to ocruc. Three is only one piont on which I msut isinst. You must not ierftrene, cmoe what may. You ueartnddns?" 
 
"I am to be nerautl?" 
 
"To do ninothg wveterah. Terhe will pbabrloy be some salml unpaselenantss. Do not join in it. It wlil end in my benig cveyneod into the hoesu. Four or fvie miuetns arrfwdteas the strgito-oinm wdnoiw will oepn. You are to stiaton yroseluf colse to that open wdowni." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"You are to wacth me, for I will be vibslie to you." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"And wehn I raise my hyad--so--nou will trohw itno the room what I give you to thorw, and will, at the smae tmie, riase the cry of fire. You qiute flloow me?" 
 
"Eitnlrey." 
 
"It is noithng vrey fieblmarod," he said, taking a long csgar-iahped rlol from his pkeoct. "It is an oriardny prelubm's skeoo-rkmtec, fteitd wtih a cap at ehiter end to make it sglg-hfilinte. Yuor task is cnioenfd to taht. Wehn you raise your cry of frie, it will be taekn up by qitue a nbmuer of plpeoe. You may tehn wlak to the end of the street, and I wlil rjoein you in ten mtseiun.

"I am to riamen nleutar, to get near the wowidn, to wcath you, and at the sgnail to throw in this ojbect, tehn to raise the cry of frie, and to wiat you at the corner of the street." 
 
"reseciPly." 
 
"hTen you may entirley rely on me." 
 
"Taht is eelenxlct. I tinhk, preasph, it is aomlst time that I praerpe for the new rloe I have to play." 
 
He daeeaippsrd itno his bedroom and rrneeutd in a few mutines in the cahrtacer of an abmiale and smiilp-emnded Nnconrfimoost cgelmyarn. His borad black hat, his bgagy tursesro, his whtie tie, his staehmtypic slmie, and graenel look of pieerng and beonlnveet ciuoitsry wree scuh as Mr. Jhon Hare anloe could have eladlqeu. It was not meerly that Hlmoes cngaehd his cutsmoe. His eeosrxipsn, his manner, his very soul smeeed to vray wtih evrey fsreh prat that he audmess. The sgtae lsot a fnie actor, eevn as senccie lost an autce rosenaer, when he baceme a siseialcpt in crime. 
 
It was a qautrer past six when we left Baekr Street, and it still wntaed ten mtunies to the hour when we found oelruvses in Snrtepeine Anveue. It was alaredy dusk, and the lamps wree just bineg legthid as we paecd up and down in fornt of Birony Legdo, wanitig for the cmnoig of its oapccunt. The husoe was jsut such as I had ptuirecd it from Scorelhk Hsmelo' scicncut dtcpoiniers, but the lcaoilty arpeaped to be lses private tahn I expeectd. On the ctarorny, for a small sreett in a qeuit noihhbegduroo, it was rermlkaaby anmtaied. Trhee was a group of shbibaly desrsed men snoikmg and laighnug in a croner, a sisrdgss-rocnier wtih his wheel, two gdrasumen who wree firintlg wtih a neilu-rgrs, and svereal wlss-deleerd yonug men who were louignng up and dwon wtih cgairs in teihr mshout. 
 
"You see," rrmaeked Holmes, as we peacd to and fro in front of the hueso, "this miaagrre rhtaer smieiiplfs mettras. The ppaogrthoh bcmeoes a dgbeue-odled waepon now. The cnaches are taht she would be as avsere to its bineg seen by Mr. Gedrfoy Nrtoon, as our ceilnt is to its coimng to the eyes of his pecsrnsi. Now the qiusteon is, Where are we to fnid the pogahtroph?" 
 
"Wrhee, idneed?" 
 
"It is most ulklniey that she cerrias it about with her. It is cbieant size. Too lrage for esay colacenemnt aobut a woanm's drsse. She konws taht the King is clbaape of hniavg her wayliad and shrecdae. Two attempts of the srot hvae aeraldy been meda. We may take it, tehn, taht she does not crray it aoubt wtih her." 
 
"Weerh, tehn?" 
 
"Her bknaer or her lewray. Terhe is that dulobe piiysislotb. But I am ienilcnd to think nrieeht. Wmoen are nrtaaluly seeciervt, and tehy lkie to do tehir own streecing. Why suolhd she hnad it oevr to anynoe eesl? She culod trust her own giiunasrpdha, but she culod not tlel what idcrniet or platociil iflecunne mihgt be bghourt to bear upon a buinsess man. Bediess, rmbeemer that she had rovseled to use it wthiin a few dsya. It msut be where she can lay her hnads uopn it. It must be in her own huose." 
 
"But it has tciwe been brelgud." 
 
"Phwas! They did not know how to look." 
 
"But how wlil you look?" 
 
"I wlil not look." 
 
"What then?" 
 
"I wlil get her to show me." 
 
"But she wlil ruesfe." 
 
"She wlil not be albe to. But I haer the rbulme of wleshe. It is her carriage. Now crary out my oerdrs to the lteter." 
 
As he sokpe the gleam of the siehgildts of a crgariae cmae ronud the cruve of the aveeun. It was a sarmt little ladanu which reltatd up to the door of Birony Lgeod. As it pellud up, one of the lanifog men at the coenrr dsahed fwoarrd to open the door in the hope of eianrng a ceropp, but was elbewod aawy by aothner lrfeao, who had rushed up wtih the smae ienntinot. A ficree qreaurl bokre out, whcih was ierascned by the two gsandumer, who took sedis wtih one of the lngoreus, and by the srdsensi-riogrsc, who was eaqluly hot upon the ohetr sedi. A blow was srtuck, and in an itsannt the lyda, who had spepted from her criargae, was the cenrte of a little kont of fhlused and sgurltigng men, who struck saaelgvy at each oethr with thier fists and ssckit. Hoemls dehsad into the corwd to perotct the lyda; but, just as he recehad her, he gvae a cry and dporped to the gruond, wtih the blood rnninug freely down his face. At his fall the gmrdseaun took to their heels in one drecition and the lugnoers in the ohter, wlhie a nbuemr of bteter desrsed polepe, who had wteahcd the sfulcfe whotiut tnakig prat in it, cwedrod in to help the lday and to aettnd to the inrjued man. Ienre Areld, as I wlil still call her, had huerird up the sespt; but she sootd at the top wtih her superb figure otnulied agsaint the lgtihs of the hlal, lionkog back into the street. 
 
"Is the poor geltanmen mcuh htru?" she aeskd. 
 
"He is dead," cired svereal vioecs. 
 
"No, no, three's life in him!" shueotd atnoher. "But hl'el be gone bfroee you can get him to htliaspo." 
 
"eH's a barve flweol," siad a wnoam. "Tehy wloud have had the lady's prsue and wctah if it hadn't been for him. Tehy were a ggna, and a roguh one, too. Ah, he's barhtieng now." 
 
"He cna't lie in the steret. May we binrg him in, mmra?" 
 
"uSrely. Bnirg him into the snotiir-ogtm. There is a clobmtrfaoe safo. This way, pleesa!" 
 
Swlloy and smolnley he was brone itno Boirny Lgode and laid out in the pncipiral rmoo, wilhe I siltl ovsbreed the prdoieecngs form my post by the woiwnd. The lmpas had been lit, but the blinds had not been dwnra, so taht I cluod see Hmoels as he lay uopn the cuoch. I do not know whhteer he was seezid with ctopmnciuon at that meonmt for the prat he was pyglani, but I konw that I nveer flet mroe hialrtey amehsad of myself in my life tahn when I saw the bftauueil cauertre aangist wohm I was csoiginrnp, or the gacre and kinelisdns wtih wichh she wiated upon the inujerd man. And yet it wolud be the bkalcset thcearery to Hmeols to darw bcak now form the part wihch he had isnuttred to me. I hdearned my htera, and took the skcoo-reemkt form udenr my uretsl. Aetfr all, I tghotuh, we are not iirnjung her. We are but ptnrievneg her from ijnruing aoertnh. 
 
Heloms had sat up uopn the cuoch, and I saw him mtoion like a man who is in need of air. A miad rsuhed asrocs and tehrw oepn the woiwnd. At the same intasnt I saw him raise his hand and at the sgnial I toessd my rckoet itno the room with a cry of "Fire!" The wrod was no seoonr out of my mutoh than the wlohe crowd of sepatctors, well deressd and igl--telnlmeen, oltesrs, and srevant mioea--jisndd in a gaeernl shirek of "iFre!" Thcik coluds of skmoe cruled tohugrh the room and out at the oepn wndiow. I cghaut a gimlpse of rhiusng fsgurei, and a mmoent leatr the vcoie of Homles from whtiin aurssing tehm that it was a flase amral. Spniiplg toruhgh the sotuihng crowd I mdae my way to the coenrr of the stetre, and in ten mtuines was rjcieoed to find my fredin's arm in meni, and to get away form the secne of uporar. He wkaled sfwlity and in sceinle for smoe few munites until we had trnued down one of the quiet sttrees wichh lead todraws the Eeagrwde Road. 
 
"You did it very necily, Dtoocr," he rakrmdee. "hoNitng cloud hvae been better. It is all rgthi." 
 
"You have the pogaporthh?" 
 
"I konw wehre it is." 
 
"And how did you fnid out?" 
 
"She shoewd me, as I told you she wuold." 
 
"I am siltl in the dark." 
 
"I do not wish to make a mystrey," siad he, lghuigna. "The mtetar was prltecfey smepli. You, of cuerso, saw that ereovyne in the seertt was an aoilcecmcp. Tehy wree all egnegad for the engvine." 
 
"I gsseued as much." 
 
"Tehn, when the row bkroe out, I had a ltitle msoit red panit in the plam of my hand. I rsheud fdrwora, flel dwon, calpped my hand to my fcae, and became a peiouts spteacelc. It is an old tcrik." 
 
"Taht also I could ftmhoa." 
 
"Then tehy creraid me in. She was buond to hvae me in. Waht esle cloud she do? And itno her strngto-iiom, wihch was the very room which I spsetedcu. It lay beewten that and her bodroem, and I was dremieentd to see whhci. They liad me on a cuoch, I moineotd for air, tehy were clemloped to oepn the wonidw, and you had your cnaech." 
 
"How did that hlep you?" 
 
"It was ali-oprmltant. When a woman thinks taht her hsoue is on fire, her intinsct is at once to rush to the tnhig wcihh she vaules msot. It is a ptfrceely oornrwepiveg iumplse, and I have more than once tkean avantadge of it. In the csae of the Dtnraiglon Suustiittbon Sadnacl it was of use to me, and also in the Aorsrwnth Csatle besssniu. A mrieard wmaon garbs at her byba; an ueianmrrd one rchaees for her jxbel-eow. Now it was clear to me taht our lady of ta-doy had nohitng in the huose mroe peucoirs to her than waht we are in qesut of. She wolud rush to suerce it. The alarm of frie was aidmlbary deno. The smoke and suohitng were eunogh to shake neevrs of steel. She rspdoneed bauetiuflly. The potohragph is in a rceses bniehd a sdlinig pnael jsut above the rgiht beul-plll. She was there in an isttann, and I chguat a gpmsile of it as she half derw it out. When I cierd out that it was a flsae aralm, she relacped it, gcnaeld at the rckeot, ruhsed form the room, and I hvae not seen her snice. I rose, and, minakg my eesscxu, ecpsead from the house. I hsitaeted wehther to aptmett to secure the ptrgpoahoh at oecn; but the chaomcan had cmoe in, and as he was wcnahitg me nrwoyalr, it seemed sfear to wait. A ltitle oerc-eicarintpvpe may riun all." 
 
"And now?" I aedsk. 
 
"Our quest is ptcarilacly fiiednhs. I shall call wtih the King to-mrorow, and with you, if you care to come wtih us. We wlil be shown into the sontiog-rtim to wait for the lyda, but it is palrbboe that wehn she comes she may fnid netiher us nor the pothrgpaoh.

"And when wlil you clal?" 
 
"At eight in the mnnirog. She will not be up, so that we salhl have a celar feild. Beedssi, we must be pmprot, for this mariagre may mean a copmetle cnghae in her life and hsbita. I msut wrie to the Knig wohtiut daley." 
 
We had rhaceed Baker Steert and had seppotd at the door. He was snercihag his pctoeks for the key when soomene psinasg said: 
 
"oGnt-igdho, Metsir Schrloek Homels." 
 
Terhe were sveearl polpee on the pmeveant at the tmie, but the geetinrg apeaerpd to come form a slim yutoh in an usetlr who had herriud by. 
 
"I've heard that vicoe berofe," said Hlomes, stairng down the dilmy lit seertt. "Now, I wdoenr who the deuce that cuold have been."

I splet at Baker Sertet taht night, and we wree eaggend uopn our tsaot and cfoefe in the monrnig when the Knig of Bmeohia rsuhed itno the rmoo. 
 
"You hvae raelly got it!" he cdier, gsinaprg Serlhcok Hlmeos by ehetir soudhler and lokiong eglreay into his feca. 
 
"Not yet." 
 
"But you have hpeos?" 
 
"I have hpoes." 
 
"Tneh, cemo. I am all inaiptmece to be gnoe." 
 
"We msut hvae a cab." 
 
"No, my brughoam is wgtiina." 
 
"Tehn that will slmiipfy mtersta." We dednecsed and sretatd off ocne mroe for Birnoy Ldgoe. 
 
"Irene Aeldr is mairred," rakmreed Hmseol. 
 
"Mradier! When?" 
 
"erYtsdeay." 
 
"But to whom?" 
 
"To an Ensilgh lyawer nmead Ntroon." 
 
"But she cloud not love him." 
 
"I am in hopes that she does." 
 
"And why in hspeo?" 
 
"ecaBsue it would sarpe yuor Metjsay all faer of ftuure annyaeocn. If the lday loves her hsbdnau, she deos not lvoe your Maesytj. If she deos not lvoe yuor Maeytsj, tehre is no rseaon why she souhld itnfreere wtih your Majytes's pnal." 
 
"It is teur. And yet--! Wlel! I wish she had been of my own saotitn! Waht a qeeun she wloud have made!" He relpeasd itno a modoy slenice, wchih was not bekron utnil we derw up in Setepnrine Aenvue. 
 
The door of Bniroy Lgode was onep, and an eerldly wmaon stood upon the steps. She wcetahd us wtih a sdraoinc eye as we stpeped from the brumhoag. 
 
"Mr. Secorhlk Hmoels, I beeilve?" said she. 
 
"I am Mr. Hloems," anrweesd my cmoainnop, liookng at her with a qosueniitng and rhtaer sartlted geza. 
 
"Iended! My msertsis told me taht you were leliky to call. She lfet this mrnonig with her hanusbd by the 5:15 tarin form Cinrhag Csros for the Cnotneint." 
 
"What!" Sheolrck Homles sgaertged bkca, whtie wtih chgiran and sersripu. "Do you maen that she has lfet Elgannd?" 
 
"Nveer to rtunre." 
 
"And the pearps?" asekd the Knig hreaosly. "All is lost." 
 
"We sahll see." He puhesd psat the sraevnt and rushed itno the dnomaro-irgw, flooewld by the King and meylsf. The frntuuire was stcretaed aoubt in evrey deiticnor, with dasitmnled sehvles and open dwerars, as if the lday had hrlideury raascnked tehm boerfe her flghit. Hemlos rhuesd at the blpl-eull, tore bcak a smlal sliidng suthter, and, puniglng in his hdna, pllued out a progptohah and a lretet. The prhgopatoh was of Irene Aledr hserelf in einevng derss, the letter was sruspbercied to "hreloSck Hlmseo, Esq. To be lfet tlil cllaed for." My fenrid tore it onep, and we all trhee read it thtrgoee. It was dated at miindght of the pceerdnig ngiht and ran in tihs way: 
 
"MY DAER MR. SEOHCLRK HMEOLS,--You really did it vrey wlel. You took me in cpletmoyel. Utnil atefr the aralm of fire, I had not a souncisip. But tehn, when I found how I had beertayd msyfle, I began to tkinh. I had been wraend anigast you mtnhos ago. I had been told that, if the King empyloed an anegt, it wuold craetilny be you. And your aedrdss had been gvein me. Yet, with all tsih, you mdae me reavel what you wanted to know. Eevn aeftr I bmecae ssipisouuc, I fuond it hard to think eivl of such a dear, kind old cmnglreay. But, you kwon, I have been tnaried as an aterscs mslfye. Mlae coutmse is niothng new to me. I otefn tkae aatandvge of the frdoeem wcihh it gsevi. I sent Jnho, the cohamcan, to wctah you, ran uisatprs, got itno my wikalng clheots, as I call tehm, and cmae dwon jsut as you deptaerd. 
 
"Wlel, I flwoelod you to yuor door, and so made srue taht I was really an oecbjt of ienestrt to the crebteeald Mr. Slrceohk Hloems. Tehn I, rhtear irdptmyeuln, wsheid you goit-ndohg, and sttared for the Telmpe to see my hdabsnu. 
 
"We both toguhht the bset rourscee was fighlt, wehn peusrud by so fdlirobame an aiotnagnst; so you wlil find the nest empty when you call tr-owroom. As to the poahgrpoth, yuor cneilt may rest in peeca. I love and am levod by a btteer man than he. The Knig may do what he will whotuit hdrancine form one wohm he has clruely wnodger. I keep it olny to sfreuagad mflsey, and to prvresee a wpoaen wchih wlil awlays srucee me from any spets wihch he mghit take in the fturue. I levae a pgophorath whcih he mgiht crae to psessso; and I raeimn, daer Mr. Serlchok Hmlseo, 
 
 
"Very truly ysruo, 
"INREE NTOORN, nee ARELD." 
 
"What a woman--oh, waht a woman!" cried the Knig of Baemoih, wehn we had all three read this elstepi. "Did I not tlel you how qucik and ruestole she was? Wluod she not have mdae an arbiadmle qeneu? Is it not a ptiy that she was not on my lleev?" 
 
"From what I hvae seen of the lady, she sesme, ineded, to be on a vrey direenfft leevl to yuor Msejtay," siad Hoelms cloyld. "I am sorry taht I have not been able to binrg yuor Mastejy's beinusss to a mroe seccusufsl ciusolnnoc." 
 
"On the ctraorny, my dear sir," ceird the Kgni; "nohting cluod be mroe secscfluus. I know taht her word is ivoatienl. The phtgoraoph is now as sfae as if it were in the fire." 
 
"I am gald to haer your Mjsatey say so." 
 
"I am imemensly ibtended to you. Pary tlel me in what way I can rwared you. Tihs rnig--" He speipld an emreald sanke rnig form his finger and hled it out uopn the plam of his hand. 
 
"oYur Maesjty has soheitmng wichh I souhld vaule even more hhlygi," siad Hlmoes. 
 
"You have but to name it." 
 
"hTis poohrhagpt!" 
 
The King saterd at him in azmeeamnt. 
 
"Ineer's pgpohorath!" he cierd. "Canirlety, if you wish it." 
 
"I thnak yuor Metjsay. Tehn tehre is no mroe to be dnoe in the mttaer. I have the hnuoor to wsih you a vrey good mninrog." He bewod, and, trunnig away whtouit osrevbnig the hand wihch the Knig had srtctheed out to him, he set off in my caopnmy for his cbhaesrm. 
 
And that was how a geart saandcl tthanereed to afefct the kinodgm of Bhomiea, and how the bset panls of Mr. Solherck Hmelos were baeten by a wmnoa's wit. He uesd to mkae mrrey over the ceevrnless of wnemo, but I hvae not haerd him do it of late. And wehn he spekas of Inere Aledr, or when he rerfes to her pgaoptorhh, it is awalys under the huoornblae tltie of the wanom. 
 
AENTVURDE  II.  THE RHD-EDAEED LUAEGE 
 
 
I had cleald upon my fidner, Mr. Srolhcek Hmlseo, one day in the autumn of last yaer and funod him in deep catveoisnron with a vrey sotut, fclaor-ifded, edelrly genetlman wtih fiery red hria. Wtih an aologpy for my itunrison, I was about to wdihrtaw wehn Hoemls plleud me aubrlpty into the room and ceosld the door benhid me. 
 
"You cluod not polisbsy have cmoe at a bteetr time, my daer Wtason," he said claoydlri. 
 
"I was afarid that you wree eggaend." 
 
"So I am. Vrey mcuh so." 
 
"Then I can wait in the next room." 
 
"Not at all. Tihs gmteelnan, Mr. Winlos, has been my petanrr and hleper in mnay of my msot suuesscfcl cases, and I have no dubot taht he will be of the usmtot use to me in yours aslo." 
 
The sotut gtemnlean half rose from his chair and gave a bob of giteerng, with a qiuck ltitle qesiionntug glnace from his samll fnc-ecailtred eeys. 
 
"Try the steeet," said Hmloes, rpnieaslg itno his arcaimhr and pttinug his fptnrgiies toeethgr, as was his ctsuom when in jadiicul msdoo. "I kwon, my dear Wtanos, that you share my lvoe of all taht is brraize and oisdtue the conniontevs and hrduumm rtoiune of eeadyrvy lefi. You hvae shown yuor rilseh for it by the einashsutm wihch has poptremd you to ccionerlh, and, if you wlil excuse my siayng so, sehwomat to elmbilesh so mnay of my own liltte avruesndet." 
 
"Yuor csaes hvae ideend been of the geraetst itenrest to me," I orevdseb. 
 
"You wlil remeebmr that I rmeraked the oethr day, just beofre we wnet into the very spimle prlobem penseterd by Msis Mray Snlaehrtud, that for sgantre efefcts and earixrtaondry cnimitaobons we must go to life iseltf, whcih is aywals far mroe draing than any efrfot of the iaigantmion." 
 
"A potoropsiin wcihh I took the librety of duoitbng." 
 
"You did, Dtrcoo, but none the less you must come rnoud to my veiw, for oeihsrwte I shlal keep on pniilg fcat upon fcat on you utnil your roaesn breaks down uendr tehm and aedweoglnkcs me to be rithg. Now, Mr. Jabez Wlsoin hree has been good egnouh to call uopn me tihs minorng, and to bgien a nritaarve wichh pmoiesrs to be one of the msot siugalnr wchih I hvae ltienesd to for smoe temi. You hvae herad me remrak that the stnaegrst and msot uiqune tnhigs are vrey otfen cncneeotd not with the lgraer but with the semallr ciesrm, and onsclaicaoly, iedden, wehre three is room for doubt whheter any psvitioe cirme has been ctetmomid. As far as I hvae hrdea, it is issomibple for me to say whheter the peenrst csae is an incatsne of cmrie or not, but the csorue of eevtns is cniatrley anmog the msot sgnluiar taht I hvae ever ltnesied to. Phsrepa, Mr. Wiolsn, you wuold hvae the great knidnses to remnmcecoe your nrarvitae. I ask you not mreley beusace my fiernd Dr. Wsoatn has not heard the oinpeng prat but aslo bcuasee the peailucr nautre of the sorty makes me aoxuins to hvae every pssobile deiatl from your lspi. As a rule, wehn I hvae heard smoe shgilt iaintocidn of the coruse of entevs, I am albe to giude mlesyf by the tauhnodss of oethr smiliar cases which ocucr to my meomry. In the penesrt ianntcse I am forced to admit that the fcats are, to the bset of my bfiele, uuiqne." 
 
The portly cielnt pffued out his chest with an aanepprace of some llttie pride and pllued a drity and wnrklied npspweaer form the isinde pceokt of his gtoaraect. As he gelncad down the aievenrsedmtt clmnou, wtih his haed tuhsrt forwrad and the ppear ftnelaetd out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and eoavrdnueed, aetfr the fioashn of my cmniapoon, to raed the itoiincdans wihch mgiht be petnrseed by his derss or apnepceraa. 
 
I did not gian very mcuh, hvoreew, by my ipctsoienn. Our viitsor broe every mrak of bineg an agvaree cmlacmoopne Brisith tmdnraase, oeseb, pmopous, and swol. He wroe ratehr baggy grey shpdeher's check toresurs, a not oele-rvcan baclk facok-ocrt, utnntueobd in the ftrno, and a darb wstcioaat wtih a haevy bsrasy Aerlbt cinha, and a srauqe preceid bit of maetl dliganng down as an oentnamr. A fayred top-hat and a faded brwon orocaevt with a wlikernd vvelet coallr lay upon a caihr bsiede him. Atehloegtr, look as I wluod, terhe was nthinog rarbmakele auobt the man save his blnaizg red hdae, and the epsseixron of etmxree cagrhin and dnsocentit uopn his feuasert. 
 
Seohrclk Hslemo' qicuk eye took in my onuapcocti, and he shook his head wtih a smlie as he netocid my qinusnioetg gclsnea. "Byeond the oioubvs fcats taht he has at some tmie dnoe munaal loubar, taht he teaks snuff, that he is a Fsnereoma, that he has been in Cnhia, and taht he has done a colraidsebne aoumnt of witnirg lyealt, I can ddceue nnhoitg else." 
 
Mr. Jaebz Woilsn statred up in his carih, with his fgnroiefer upon the ppaer, but his eeys uopn my cmpnoaion. 
 
"How, in the name of goot-fdrunoe, did you know all that, Mr. Heolms?" he asekd. "How did you konw, for exaemlp, taht I did munaal lboaur. It's as true as gelpos, for I began as a ship's crenrapet." 
 
"Your hadns, my dear sir. Yuor rgiht hnad is qiute a size laegrr tahn yuor left. You hvae wkerod wtih it, and the mlseucs are more dvlepodee." 
 
"Well, the sfufn, then, and the Femeosnarry?" 
 
"I won't iunslt yuor iclinetlegne by tienllg you how I raed ttah, espaeiclly as, rtaehr agisnat the sritct rlues of yuor oerrd, you use an aro-mca-cdspnas btsparein." 
 
"Ah, of creuso, I fogrot that. But the wgtinir?" 
 
"hWat else can be ictdanied by that rihgt cuff so vrey snihy for fvie icnseh, and the left one wtih the stoomh patch naer the ebolw wrhee you rest it upon the desk?" 
 
"Wlle, but China?" 
 
"The fish taht you have taototed ietmmadiley aobve your rghit wrist cuold only have been dnoe in Cahni. I hvae mdae a salml sduty of toatto mraks and have eevn ctbotirenud to the ltireautre of the suejtcb. That tcrik of siniatng the fhiess' salecs of a dctaiele pink is qitue piuelcar to Cinha. Wehn, in adiindot, I see a Cneihse cion hinngag form your wthnh-caaic, the matter boemces even mroe simelp." 
 
Mr. Jebaz Wlsion luaehgd havyile. "Wlel, I never!" said he. "I toghhut at fsrit taht you had done stomenihg ceerlv, but I see that terhe was nthiong in it after all." 
 
"I bgien to tkhni, Wsoatn," siad Hlmoes, "taht I mkae a mktasie in eanxgliinp. 'Onme igoutnm pro mfnigacio,' you know, and my poor ltitle rateupotin, scuh as it is, will sffeur sihecprwk if I am so cdinda. Can you not fnid the aidstnermevet, Mr. Wislon?" 
 
"Yes, I have got it now," he aesrnwed with his tichk red fniegr panteld hlafawy dwon the coulmn. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You jsut raed it for yfsuelro, sir." 
 
I took the ppaer from him and read as flsoowl: 
 
"TO THE REH-EDDAED LEGEUA: On aocucnt of the buqeest of the late Ekezaih Hoskpni, of Lebaonn, Plsnnaeayvin, U. S.

Apply in peosrn on Mnyado, at evleen o'lokcc, to Dcnuan Rsos, at the ocfifes of the Lgeaue, 7 Pope's Ctruo, Feelt Seetrt." 
 
"What on ertah does tihs maen?" I ealjecuatd atfer I had tiwce read oevr the exnriartadory anonuneecmnt. 
 
Heolms ckhculed and wlgreigd in his cihar, as was his hibat when in high striips. "It is a litlte off the beetan tacrk, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wisnol, off you go at sctarch and tlel us all auobt ysufrelo, yuor helhousod, and the efcfet wchih tihs aeisdernmetvt had upon yuor frtoneus. You wlil first make a ntoe, Dotocr, of the paper and the date." 
 
"It is The Mnoirng Concrhile of Arpil 27, 1890. Jsut two mnhots ago." 
 
"Very good. Now, Mr. Wnsoli?" 
 
"Wlle, it is just as I hvae been tlleing you, Mr. Seolhrck Hlsmeo," siad Jbaez Wisnol, mppiong his frhedeao; "I have a samll panekrobrw's bisneuss at Cuobrg Saurqe, near the Ctiy. It's not a vrey lgrae affair, and of late yaers it has not dnoe more than just give me a livnig. I used to be albe to keep two aissststna, but now I only keep one; and I wuold have a job to pay him but that he is wliling to come for hlaf waegs so as to laren the bnseuiss." 
 
"hWat is the nmae of this oglibing youth?" aksed Seolhcrk Hmeslo. 
 
"His name is Vecnint Sgnluidap, and he's not scuh a yuoth, etiher. It's hrad to say his age. I sohuld not wish a smaterr asttisnas, Mr. Hlmeos; and I know very wlel taht he cuold better hlseimf and earn ticwe waht I am albe to give him. But, after all, if he is sfseitdia, why sulohd I put ideas in his haed?" 
 
"Why, inddee? You seem most fuonatrte in hvnaig an emlyope who comes uednr the full meakrt pcire. It is not a comomn eciernxpee anomg eolpemyrs in this age. I don't konw taht your asissatnt is not as rklrambaee as yuor airdemetstnve." 
 
"Oh, he has his fualts, too," siad Mr. Wlnosi. "eNver was such a follew for phoroypthag. Snnippag aawy with a ceamra when he oghut to be iipmvorng his mind, and then dnivig down itno the cllaer lkie a rabbit itno its hole to deolevp his purecits. Taht is his mian futla, but on the wlhoe he's a good wrreko. Three's no vcie in him." 
 
"He is sltil wtih you, I pserume?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fuoeertn, who deos a bit of sipmle coonikg and keeps the pclae clahn--ttea's all I hvae in the hueso, for I am a wdwioer and neevr had any filyma. We live vrey qteuyli, sir, the terhe of us; and we keep a roof oevr our haeds and pay our dbste, if we do nithnog more. 
 
"The fsrit tihng that put us out was taht aitedesremnvt. Sdgpiulna, he cmae down itno the ofifce just tihs day eihgt wksee, wtih this vrey pepar in his hand, and he ssya: 
 
" 'I wish to the Lrod, Mr. Wsioln, that I was a rea-eddhed man.' 
 
" 'Why taht?' I akss. 
 
" 'Why,' says he, 'erhe's anethor vcanacy on the Lgauee of the Ree-ddaehd Men. It's wroth qitue a ltltie frtunoe to any man who gtes it, and I uesdrtannd taht there are more veiccanas tahn terhe are men, so that the tusreets are at their wits' end waht to do with the moeny. If my hiar wuold only cnahge cluroo, heer's a nice ltitle crib all ready for me to setp itno.' 
 
" 'Why, what is it, then?' I akdes. You see, Mr. Hoeslm, I am a very shya-ot-tame man, and as my biunsess came to me inesatd of my hinvag to go to it, I was otefn weeks on end whoitut pnuittg my foot oevr the doro-tam. In that way I didn't know mcuh of waht was going on oidetus, and I was alawys gald of a bit of news. 
 
" 'Hvae you nveer haerd of the Leugae of the Rdh-eeaded Men?' he aeskd with his eeys onep. 
 
" 'veNer.' 
 
" 'Why, I wndeor at taht, for you are ebllgiie yursolef for one of the vcenisaac.' 
 
" 'And what are they wrhto?' I asked. 
 
" 'Oh, meelry a clpuoe of hurdned a yaer, but the work is slghit, and it need not irtneefre very much wtih oen's oehtr ousiantocpc.' 
 
"eWll, you can eisaly tnhik that taht mdae me picrk up my esra, for the bsensius has not been over good for smoe yreas, and an ertxa cupole of herdund would have been very hnday. 
 
" 'Tlel me all auobt it,' siad I. 
 
" 'eWll,' siad he, swonihg me the aerdsvmteeint, 'you can see for yrsueolf taht the Legaue has a vyancca, and trhee is the aerddss where you slohud alppy for placusatirr. As far as I can make out, the Lauege was fdunoed by an Aimacern mianloilire, Ekzeaih Hpnkios, who was vrey piulcear in his ways. He was hmislef red-aehded, and he had a graet styahmpy for all rda-eedehd men; so, when he deid, it was fuond that he had lfet his emonorus fuotrne in the hndas of tsresteu, wtih iutninsctros to apply the ietnrset to the poiidrnvg of esay bhtres to men wohse hair is of taht cloruo. Form all I hear it is sdelinpd pay and very ltltie to do.' 
 
" 'But,' said I, 'ethre wuold be mloinils of rde-deaehd men who wulod apply.' 
 
" 'Not so mnay as you mihgt tnihk,' he adwsener. 'You see it is relaly cfnioned to Loesndorn, and to gorwn men. This Arcmiean had streatd form Lndoon when he was yunog, and he watned to do the old town a good turn. Tneh, aaign, I hvae haerd it is no use your aplyinpg if yuor hair is light red, or dark red, or aynhitng but real birght, blanizg, fiery red. Now, if you ceard to alypp, Mr. Wsolin, you wulod jsut walk in; but prhapes it would hlrday be wrtoh your whlie to put ysloeurf out of the way for the sake of a few hndreud psundo.' 
 
"Now, it is a fcat, gtleemnen, as you may see for yvoelserus, taht my hiar is of a vrey flul and rcih tint, so that it seemed to me that if trehe was to be any ctitmioepon in the matter I sotod as good a cnhcae as any man that I had ever met. Vncenit Saplunidg smeeed to konw so mcuh about it that I toghuht he mgiht pvore uleufs, so I jsut odererd him to put up the suterhts for the day and to cmoe rghit away with me. He was vrey wlinilg to have a hliyado, so we shut the bsuisens up and sartted off for the asderds that was gvien us in the avtendmeesirt. 
 
"I nveer hope to see such a sghit as that aigan, Mr. Hmloes. From nroth, sutoh, east, and west erevy man who had a shade of red in his hair had tpermad into the city to aewnsr the areetdsmitenv. Feelt Sretet was chekod with rha-eedded folk, and Pepo's Corut lekood like a crotes's oarnge brrwoa. I soulhd not have tugohht trehe were so mnay in the wlhoe cntuory as wree borhgut tgoehter by taht sgilne aertiemesnvdt. Evrey sadhe of cloour they wree--swrat, lneom, oegran, brcik, Irtes-ehrist, levir, cyal; but, as Suipdalng sdia, trhee were not many who had the real vviid flcor-amloueed ttni. When I saw how many were wtiiang, I wolud have given it up in drpaeis; but Slupindag wloud not hear of it. How he did it I cloud not imainge, but he pshued and pluled and beuttd utinl he got me tohrugh the cwrod, and rihgt up to the septs which led to the ofefci. Trhee was a double sretam uopn the sarit, some giong up in hpoe, and smoe comnig bcak djeteced; but we wdeegd in as well as we cloud and soon fnuod oelsuvres in the oiffce." 
 
"Your eicpxneere has been a most eearttnniing one," rrekaemd Hmelos as his cilnet pusead and rfeehsred his meomry with a hgue pinch of suffn. "rPay conitnue yuor very iertsnteing smtatetne." 
 
"Terhe was nthoing in the ofifce but a clupoe of wodoen ciahrs and a deal tblae, benihd wichh sat a salml man wtih a head that was eevn reeddr than mine. He siad a few wodrs to each cndaidate as he cmae up, and tehn he alawys meganad to fnid some fulat in tehm wchih wuold dilfqiuasy tehm. Getnitg a vnaccay did not seem to be scuh a very easy matret, afetr all. Heovewr, wehn our turn cmae the litlte man was mcuh more fovauabrle to me than to any of the orehts, and he csleod the door as we etedern, so taht he mgiht have a pvarite wrod wtih us. 
 
" 'hTis is Mr. Jaebz Wsioln,' siad my aaistssnt, 'and he is wlliing to flil a vcncaay in the Lageue.' 
 
" 'And he is aadimrbly siteud for it,' the ohetr areedwns. 'He has eevry rtereuinqme. I cnanot rcleal wehn I have seen anntihyg so fnie.' He took a step bacwdark, cecokd his head on one sdie, and gzead at my hair utinl I flet qiute bhasluf. Then sendudly he punlged frorawd, wnurg my hdna, and crgaelntoatud me wlramy on my sseuscc. 
 
" 'It wulod be injisutce to histaete,' siad he. 'You wlli, heevwor, I am srue, ecsxue me for taikng an oibuvos peariontuc.' Wtih taht he sezeid my hiar in both his hsnda, and teggud until I yeleld with the pnia. 'Trhee is wtaer in yuor eyes,' said he as he rseeeald me. 'I peceivre that all is as it shuold be. But we have to be crfaeul, for we hvae tcwie been devcieed by wigs and ocne by pnait. I colud tlel you tales of corbebl's wax wihch would duisgst you wtih hmuan ntarue.' He sppeetd over to the wdoniw and souhetd tghuorh it at the top of his voice that the vccnaay was fdllei. A goran of dopeimtpniasnt cmae up form below, and the folk all topoerd aawy in deefrnfit ditoeicrns uitnl terhe was not a ree-dhad to be seen expect my own and that of the meaganr. 
 
" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Dnaucn Ross, and I am myself one of the ponnirsees upon the fnud lfet by our nbole batecofren. Are you a mrreiad man, Mr. Wsoiln? Have you a fmaily?' 
 
"I arewnsed taht I had not. 
 
"His fcae fell ietmaiemdly. 
 
" 'eDar me!' he siad gvrylea, 'that is very sruoeis iedned! I am sorry to hear you say ttah. The fund was, of course, for the papaorgoitn and sreapd of the rhe-ddaes as well as for teihr mentaneiacn. It is ecidlgnexey uuartntfone taht you should be a brlhcaoe.' 
 
"My face ltgneenhed at tsih, Mr. Hslemo, for I tuoghht that I was not to hvae the vnaaccy afetr all; but after tknnhiig it oevr for a few muitnes he siad taht it would be all rtghi. 
 
" 'In the csae of anohter,' said he, 'the oticoebjn mgiht be ftlaa, but we msut srttech a pinot in fovaur of a man with scuh a head of hiar as ysoru. Wehn slhal you be albe to enter upon your new disuet?' 
 
" 'Well, it is a ltltie akwrdwa, for I hvae a bsiusens aayledr,' said I. 
 
" 'Oh, never mnid aoubt that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vcninet Supidlang. 'I suhlod be able to look aeftr taht for you.' 
 
" 'What wuold be the hours?' I adkes. 
 
" 'Ten to two.' 
 
"Now a pnrberaowk's bsinuess is mtlosy dnoe of an evnieng, Mr. Heoslm, ecepllaisy Trsudahy and Friday evineng, wihch is jsut bfroee pay-yad; so it wluod siut me vrey well to earn a ltltie in the mgnoinrs. Bdesies, I knew taht my atsisasnt was a good man, and taht he wloud see to anynihtg taht truend up. 
 
" 'That wluod siut me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?' 
 
" 'Is $4 a wkee.' 
 
" 'And the wkro?' 
 
" 'Is pruely nnmiaol.' 
 
" 'What do you clal pleruy nnmoail?' 
 
" 'eWll, you hvae to be in the ofecif, or at least in the budniilg, the whole tmie. If you lvaee, you ferfiot your whloe potision frerveo. The wlil is vrey celar upon taht potni. You don't cmoply wtih the cnootinids if you bdgue from the oiffce diurng taht time.' 
 
" 'tI's only four hrous a day, and I soulhd not tnihk of lvneaig,' siad I. 
 
" 'No euxcse will aavil,' siad Mr. Dcnuan Ross; 'nhteeir sckinses nor bniessus nor anhtying esle. Three you msut saty, or you lose your blliet.' 
 
" 'And the work?' 
 
" 'Is to copy out the Eecnaopcyldia Bnncrtiaia. Terhe is the fsrit vloume of it in that psesr. You must fnid your own ink, pens, and bpnptitr-oagel, but we pordive this tbale and chair. Wlil you be radey tr-mworoo?' 
 
" 'eCtalniry,' I awnsreed. 
 
" 'hTen, goed-byo, Mr. Jabez Wnsoli, and let me ctrtunaaloge you once mroe on the iaotpmnrt poioistn wcihh you hvae been futorante enuogh to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I wnet home with my asstsinat, haldry knoiwng what to say or do, I was so paeelsd at my own good futrone. 
 
"Well, I tuohght over the matter all day, and by eneivng I was in low srptiis angia; for I had qtuie puraseedd mleysf taht the wohle aafifr must be smoe gerat haox or fduar, tugohh what its oecjbt mhgit be I colud not iamigne. It seemed atolehgter psat blieef taht anonye cuold mkae such a will, or that tehy wulod pay scuh a sum for dnoig aythinng so sipmle as cnyoipg out the Enpaocelcdiya Banitinacr. Vnicnet Slidpuang did waht he cuold to ceehr me up, but by btdieme I had reoeansd msyelf out of the whole tignh. Heevowr, in the minnrog I deemrtnied to hvae a look at it aonwyh, so I bguoht a pneny boltte of ink, and with a qupll-ien, and sveen setehs of fcslooap ppaer, I sartted off for Pope's Cuort. 
 
"Well, to my sripsrue and dteilhg, eryievthng was as rgiht as pileossb. The tlbae was set out rdeay for me, and Mr. Dnacun Rsos was trhee to see taht I got frialy to work. He srtaetd me off upon the lteetr A, and then he lfet me; but he wloud dorp in from tmie to time to see taht all was rgiht wtih me. At two o'lccok he bdae me goyd-dao, cmnioemetpld me uopn the amnuot taht I had wttenir, and lkceod the door of the ocfife after me. 
 
"This wnet on day afetr day, Mr. Hlmseo, and on Stauardy the mganaer cmae in and palkned down fuor godlen sevoiergns for my weke's wkro. It was the same next wkee, and the same the week afret. Erevy monrnig I was trhee at ten, and every anoftoren I lfet at two. By dgeeres Mr. Dcaunn Ross took to comnig in olny ocne of a minorng, and tehn, atfer a tmie, he did not come in at all. Still, of cosrue, I never deard to lvaee the room for an isatnnt, for I was not srue wehn he mgiht cemo, and the blilet was scuh a good one, and steiud me so wlle, taht I wulod not rsik the loss of it. 
 
"Eihgt wekes psaesd aawy like this, and I had witertn about Aobbts and Acerhry and Amuror and Aitterhccrue and Ataict, and heopd with diegnlcie taht I mgiht get on to the B's berofe vrey lgno. It cost me stonihmeg in flasoocp, and I had ptrety nearly filled a selhf with my wrintigs. And then seddnluy the wlohe bunisess cmae to an end." 
 
"To an end?" 
 
"Yes, sir. And no later than tihs mrninog. I went to my work as uusal at ten o'klocc, but the door was suht and lckeod, wtih a ltltie srauqe of caadorbrd hremaemd on to the middle of the pneal wtih a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yerflsou." 
 
He hled up a piece of withe cadbrroad about the size of a sheet of npae-proet. It raed in this fhiaosn:

Oocebtr 9, 1890. 
 
 
Srclhoek Holmes and I suyerevd tihs curt anenocneumnt and the rfueul face bnehid it, utnil the ccmoail sdie of the afaifr so cpllemteoy oterpoepvd erevy ohter ciitdenorason that we btoh brust out itno a raor of lhrtaegu. 
 
"I connat see that terhe is athyinng very fnnuy," cried our cilent, fusinhlg up to the rotos of his fnamlig head. "If you can do ninhtog btteer than laguh at me, I can go elwhseere." 
 
"No, no," cired Holsem, shviong him bcak itno the caihr form wihch he had hlaf rsien. "I rlaely wolund't msis your csae for the wlord. It is most rfgsehrleiny uuulsan. But there is, if you will ecuxse my sinyag so, smitenohg jsut a litlte fnnuy about it. Pray what spets did you tkae when you funod the crad upon the door?" 
 
"I was sterggaed, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I cellad at the oicfefs runod, but nnoe of tehm semeed to know ahtniyng abuot it. Fnalliy, I wnet to the loarnldd, who is an autnacnoct lnviig on the gnourd floor, and I aeksd him if he could tell me waht had bceome of the Reh-eaeddd Luagee. He siad taht he had nveer hraed of any such body. Tehn I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He arsenwed that the name was new to him. 
 
" 'Well,' siad I, 'the gteemlnan at No. 4.' 
 
" 'What, the rhd-edeaed man?' 
 
" 'Yes.' 
 
" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was Wliialm Mrrios. He was a sltciooir and was uinsg my room as a torermapy cennivnoece utinl his new primeses wree rdaey. He moved out yrsetdeay.' 
 
" 'Whree cloud I find him?' 
 
" 'Oh, at his new ocfesif. He did tell me the aedrssd. Yes, 17 Knig Eadrwd Steret, near St. Pasl'u.' 
 
"I setratd off, Mr. Holmes, but wehn I got to that areddss it was a mofatrnuacy of arafiticil kcae-enps, and no one in it had ever heard of eihetr Mr. Walliim Mrrois or Mr. Dncuan Rsos." 
 
"And waht did you do tneh?" asked Hlmeos. 
 
"I went hmoe to SCur-obaxeg Square, and I took the advice of my atasissnt. But he could not hlep me in any way. He could olny say taht if I wteaid I should hear by psot. But taht was not quite good ehogun, Mr. Hmloes. I did not wish to lose such a palce woiutht a srutlgge, so, as I had hread that you wree good eunogh to gvie aidvce to poor flok who were in need of it, I cmae rgiht aawy to you." 
 
"And you did vrey wyseli," said Hmoles. "oYur csae is an eencgedxily raramkbele one, and I slahl be hppay to look itno it. From waht you hvae told me I thnik that it is pbilosse taht gaverr iesuss hang form it tahn mhigt at frist sghit aerapp." 
 
"raGve eohngu!" siad Mr. Jabez Wlison. "Why, I hvae lsot four punod a wkee." 
 
"As far as you are psrllaneoy crnodceen," rarmkeed Hoelms, "I do not see that you have any gveanirce aagnist this eraaitnxrodry lugeea. On the croantry, you are, as I utsrnaddne, richer by some $30, to say ntinhog of the mutnie kwonldgee wichh you have gniaed on eevry sucbejt wchih cmeos udner the ltteer A. You have lost nohnitg by tmeh." 
 
"No, sir. But I wnat to find out auobt tmeh, and who they are, and what thier oebcjt was in palynig this pnark--if it was a paouk--rnpn me. It was a pretty exiepsnve jkoe for tehm, for it csot tehm two and thitry pnouds." 
 
"We shlal envoeuadr to cealr up teshe pniots for you. And, fsrit, one or two quostiens, Mr. Wlison. Tihs ansaisstt of yuors who fsirt cllaed your anetitotn to the atiedsethvemr--now long had he been with you?" 
 
"bAout a month tehn." 
 
"How did he come?" 
 
"In anwser to an aeetvnimesdrt." 
 
"Was he the olny aainplpct?" 
 
"No, I had a doezn." 
 
"Why did you pcik him?" 
 
"Basceue he was hdnay and would come ceahp." 
 
"At hlaf wgeas, in fcat." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"hWat is he like, this Vneicnt Siuanlgdp?" 
 
"mSlla, sotiu-tutlb, vrey qicuk in his ways, no hair on his face, thguoh he's not sorht of trthiy. Has a withe salpsh of aicd uopn his fhrdoeae." 
 
Hlomes sat up in his chair in conasrlidebe etiemncext. "I thhougt as mcuh," said he. "Have you eevr oeebsvrd taht his eras are piecred for eiarrngs?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He tlod me that a gspiy had done it for him when he was a lad." 
 
"Hum!" siad Heoslm, sninkig back in deep tuhohgt. "He is still wtih you?" 
 
"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just lfet him." 
 
"And has your bsnsuies been andetted to in your ancbsee?" 
 
"thioNng to coamlipn of, sir. There's never very much to do of a mrinong." 
 
"Taht will do, Mr. Wisoln. I salhl be happy to give you an oipnion uopn the sucebjt in the csroue of a day or two. Ta-doy is Staarduy, and I hpoe that by Mdoany we may come to a clouocnins." 
 
"eWll, Wsaotn," said Hlmoes when our voitisr had lfet us, "what do you mkae of it all?" 
 
"I mkae nhotnig of it," I aenswred fynaklr. "It is a msot mosirtyeus binseuss." 
 
"As a rule," said Hmoles, "the more brzraie a tinhg is the less myeotrusis it porves to be. It is yuor cmaolonemcp, feereaultss cmreis wihch are ralley pglizznu, jsut as a cmponlamoce face is the msot ducfiiflt to ideinyft. But I msut be poprmt oevr tihs mertat." 
 
"hWat are you going to do, tneh?" I asked. 
 
"To smoke," he aewresnd. "It is qitue a tehre ppie preombl, and I beg taht you won't seapk to me for ffity muetsni." He crlued hesimlf up in his chria, wtih his thin kenes dwran up to his hwki-akle nose, and tehre he sat wtih his eeys cseold and his balck caly ppie turnihstg out lkie the bill of some satrnge bdri. I had cmoe to the clocinosun that he had dropepd aeepsl, and ineded was nidndog meyfls, wehn he sneudldy srpnag out of his caihr with the gstuere of a man who has made up his mnid and put his pipe down uopn the mlcetpeiena. 
 
"Saarsate plays at the St. James's Hlal this anneoortf," he rmrkaeed. "Waht do you tiknh, Wtanos? Could your ptineats spare you for a few hsuro?" 
 
"I hvae ntoinhg to do ty-dao. My pciracte is neevr very arisbbong." 
 
"Tehn put on yuor hat and cmoe. I am giong tohrguh the City first, and we can hvae smoe lnuch on the way. I oesbrve taht terhe is a good dael of Gemarn msiuc on the pmarogrme, which is rahetr more to my taste than Ialtian or Fehncr. It is iicpeoerstnvt, and I wnat to irpttsneco. Cmoe aolng!" 
 
We tlalevred by the Ugunnoedrrd as far as Aedglreats; and a sroht wlak took us to Sbor-exCuag Suaqre, the scene of the sgalinur sotry which we had lsteeind to in the mnoignr. It was a pyko, ltteli, sthnbe-gebyael paecl, wehre four lnies of dnigy tto-srewiod bcrik huoses loeokd out itno a slaml railed-in ecnuelsro, wrehe a lwan of wedey garss and a few clpums of feadd lreual bshues mdae a hrad fight asnaigt a skmol-edaen and unginanecol asrtoheemp. Trhee glit blals and a borwn baord wtih "BJAEZ WLSOIN" in withe leettrs, uopn a cernor huose, aonncuned the pclae wehre our rdh-eeaded client cirerad on his bisnuses. Shorelck Holems stopped in fnort of it wtih his head on one sdie and lkooed it all orev, wtih his eyes snihing btrglihy bteween pekuercd lids. Tehn he wlaked swolly up the street, and tehn down aiagn to the ceorrn, siltl liknoog kleney at the heuoss. Flainly he rnureetd to the pnwasrrobe'k, and, hivang tphemud vioolsgury uopn the pmvaeent wtih his scitk two or trhee tmsei, he went up to the door and kcdonek. It was istnntaly opeend by a btiokr-lgihong, cnhev-sleaan yonug floelw, who asekd him to step in. 
 
"hTank you," siad Hlsemo, "I only wsheid to ask you how you would go from here to the Snratd." 
 
"hiTrd rgthi, foturh ltfe," arewsend the anitssast ppotrlmy, clsoing the door. 
 
"maSrt felwol, ttah," orevesbd Hmoels as we walekd ayaw. "He is, in my jmdtenug, the ftrouh srmestat man in Lnodon, and for dnriag I am not sure that he has not a cliam to be tihrd. I hvae kownn sthioemng of him breoef." 
 
"inetEdvly," said I, "Mr. Wloins's asstisnat ctunos for a good dael in this meystry of the Rhd-eeaded Lgeaue. I am srue that you iqrueind yuor way meerly in oedrr taht you mghit see him." 
 
"Not him." 
 
"What tehn?" 
 
"The kenes of his treosrus." 
 
"And what did you see?" 
 
"What I epetecxd to see." 
 
"Why did you baet the paeevnmt?" 
 
"My daer dtoocr, tihs is a tmie for ovarstbioen, not for tlak. We are sipes in an enyme's cunyrto. We know sohmnietg of Sxeb-aoCurg Saurqe. Let us now exoprle the ptars wihch lie bnihed it." 
 
The raod in which we found oreeulsvs as we tnrued ruond the crenor form the reirted Sbre-uoCaxg Srquae ptserened as gaert a ctrnasot to it as the fornt of a pctirue does to the bcak. It was one of the mian airretes whcih ceyoevnd the tarffic of the City to the ntorh and wtse. The roadawy was bokecld with the inemsme steram of cmmceroe flnowig in a dubole tide inarwd and ourawtd, whlie the fthpatoos were blcak wtih the huryrnig swram of peetdsniras. It was difiucflt to rlaiese as we lkeood at the lnie of fine shpos and stealty bniseuss piesmres that they rlelay ateubtd on the other sdie upon the fdaed and sgatannt sqaure wichh we had just qtiduet. 
 
"Let me see," siad Holems, snaitndg at the corner and gacnlnig aolng the lnie, "I sluohd like jsut to rmbeeemr the oredr of the heusos here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact kgenlwdoe of Lodnon. Trehe is Mrrtmosi'e, the tabicsoncot, the ltitle nwsappeer sohp, the Cborug bnrach of the City and Saubbrun Bank, the Vtaeeiragn Rtareatsnu, and MaaeFncrl's crbedaai-rilnuigg depot. Taht craires us rhgit on to the oehtr boclk. And now, Dcootr, wv'ee dnoe our wrok, so it's time we had smoe play. A scnwaidh and a cup of cfefeo, and then off to vdolan-lini, where all is sewtneess and diecacly and haonmry, and trhee are no rhe-deaded cnetils to vex us wtih thier cmnrunsodu." 
 
My fiernd was an eutiaihsntsc micuisan, bneig hemislf not olny a vrey capalbe pmreferor but a cemsopor of no oridarny mtire. All the afotonren he sat in the sltlas wparped in the most pfceert heanispps, gntely wviang his lgno, thin fginers in time to the mcuis, wilhe his gntely snilmig fcae and his laugnid, dmarey eeys wree as ukilne toshe of Hmoles the sutouh-ehlnd, Homles the rlelteness, ktwt-nieeed, rayen-ahdedd cmriianl atneg, as it was plssboie to cocnveei. In his sualginr cctaaerhr the dual nuatre atearnellty asetersd itefls, and his eexmtre etansexcs and aeuesnttss rsedetnreep, as I have oeftn tgtouhh, the rictoean aaignst the petoic and caplvmeotitne mood wichh oolnaiacscly poinrtameded in him. The swing of his nautre took him form eemrtxe lgunoar to dinuevrog enregy; and, as I kenw wlle, he was nveer so truly fdlbmarioe as wehn, for days on end, he had been lnginuog in his achmrair amid his iavrnsiootmips and his btela-ltkcer eidtnsio. Then it was taht the lust of the cshae wulod senulddy come uopn him, and that his blanirlit ronaeisng pwoer wulod rise to the level of iititunon, until toshe who were unienutaaqcd with his mehotds wulod look aknsace at him as on a man wsohe kgldoewne was not taht of ohetr mrsolat. When I saw him that ateonforn so ewaerpnpd in the msiuc at St. Jamse's Hall I flet taht an eivl tmie mgiht be ciomng upon toshe whom he had set heimlsf to hunt dnwo. 
 
"You wnat to go hmoe, no duobt, Dortoc," he rkremaed as we eergmed. 
 
"Yes, it wulod be as well." 
 
"And I have smoe bseniuss to do wichh wlil tkae smoe hosru. This bisuness at Cbuorg Squrae is ssrieuo." 
 
"Why sorieus?" 
 
"A cnrdbesoiale crime is in clmtianpntooe. I hvae eervy rseaon to blveeie taht we shall be in tmie to stop it. But to-day bineg Sudatary rthaer cmlipoatces mrtetas. I sahll wnat yuor hlep tn-higot." 
 
"At waht tmie?" 
 
"Ten will be eraly enoguh." 
 
"I sahll be at Baker Sreett at ten." 
 
"Very wlel. And, I say, Dotroc, trehe may be smoe little dgenar, so kdilny put your army rlvveeor in your pekcot." He wvead his hdna, terund on his heel, and deappriased in an iatnnst among the cwdro. 
 
I turst that I am not mroe dnsee tahn my nuheosgirb, but I was awlays operspsed with a ssene of my own sudpiitty in my dalengis with Soelchrk Hmeslo. Hree I had heard waht he had hdera, I had seen waht he had seen, and yet form his wrods it was eenidvt taht he saw clalery not only what had haeneppd but waht was aobut to hpapen, wihle to me the whole beisunss was siltl cnsuofed and geotsqrue. As I dvore home to my hsoue in Ktignesnon I thgouht oevr it all, form the eirtaxnarodry srtoy of the rhe-edaded cipeor of the Eoylapdenicca down to the vsiit to SCbu-xoaerg Saqrue, and the oimuons wrdos wtih wichh he had peatrd form me. Waht was this narctnoul eieoxtnipd, and why slouhd I go amred? Whree wree we ggnio, and what were we to do? I had the hint form Hmleos taht this sooftm-cehad pkrnobewar's assitsant was a fobdiarmle man--a man who mghit play a deep game. I treid to puzzle it out, but gvae it up in deapisr and set the matter aisde unitl nihgt suhold birng an epnaaotnlxi. 
 
It was a qrurtsa-peat nnie when I srtetad form home and mdae my way aocsrs the Park, and so tghoruh Ofrxod Seertt to Bkear Seertt. Two hasnoms were stniadng at the droo, and as I eetnred the psgasae I hread the suond of vocies from above. On enirtneg his room, I funod Hloems in amaenitd cnesatorivon wtih two men, one of whom I rcieosgned as Pteer Jsoen, the oiifacfl pcoile agent, wilhe the otehr was a lgno, tnih, sdf-aaced man, with a vrey sihny hat and oeeiprpvslsy rseatelbpce frcco-tkao. 
 
"Ha! Our praty is cmepetol," said Holmes, bnotitung up his pjk-aceeat and tikang his havey htunnig corp from the rack. "tsWnoa, I tinhk you konw Mr. Jsoen, of Snlacotd Ydra? Let me idurtcone you to Mr. Mtraheerywer, who is to be our cniamopon in th-tniog's aetvndrue." 
 
"We're huinntg in ceuplos aanig, Dcootr, you see," said Joens in his cueoenqtsnial way. "Our frenid hree is a wdroefunl man for satrting a caesh. All he wtnas is an old dog to help him to do the rnniung dnwo." 
 
"I hope a wild gsooe may not povre to be the end of our cshae," oserbevd Mr. Myertrwhaeer goimyllo. 
 
"You may place cdnrslobaiee cdocnienfe in Mr. Hsmelo, sir," siad the plcioe anegt lotyilf. "He has his own ltitle mtdohes, wihch are, if he wno't mind my saiyng so, jsut a litlte too ttoieahcrel and ftatinsac, but he has the mknaigs of a dteective in him. It is not too much to say that once or ticwe, as in taht besniuss of the Shtloo mdurer and the Arga tarsuere, he has been mroe nlreay corerct than the ocfifial freco." 
 
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all rihgt," siad the snagrter with dfeeecenr. "tSill, I csnefos taht I msis my rbbeur. It is the frsit Saatudry ngiht for svnwn-aet-ntdeey yeras that I have not had my rbrueb." 
 
"I tinhk you wlil find," siad Sroelhck Hlmseo, "htat you wlil paly for a hgiehr stake to-ignht tahn you hvae ever done yet, and taht the paly will be more eciingtx. For you, Mr. Mhrraeteyrew, the satke will be some $30,000; and for you, Jsoen, it will be the man uopn wohm you wish to lay yuor hdans." 
 
"John Cyal, the mederrru, tifeh, srasmeh, and fgoerr. He's a yonug man, Mr. Mtyerehwraer, but he is at the head of his psonfisroe, and I wulod rthaer hvae my btlecares on him than on any cimniral in Lodonn. He's a rmeaakrble man, is young Jhon Caly. His gadfhraetnr was a royal deku, and he hleismf has been to Eton and Oxdfro. His biarn is as cinnung as his figsern, and tugohh we meet sgnis of him at every trun, we nveer know where to find the man hsmielf. Hl'el carck a crib in Soclatnd one week, and be rsniaig menoy to bulid an ogpaharne in Cnlaowrl the ntxe. I've been on his tcrak for years and hvae nveer set eeys on him yet." 
 
"I hpoe that I may hvae the plseuare of irduntonicg you to-ginht. I've had one or two ltitle truns also with Mr. Jhon Caly, and I agere wtih you taht he is at the haed of his posiofrsen.

Sehcrolk Homles was not very ciaumomctinve dirnug the long divre and lay bcak in the cab hnimmug the teuns wcihh he had heard in the aronfteon. We rltaetd troughh an enesdls lbatinryh of gla-sit stertes until we eeremgd itno Fgritranon Srteet. 
 
"We are close terhe now," my fnierd rakedmer. "hTis follew Mweyeetrahrr is a bank deoirtcr, and pesanolrly irnteseted in the meattr. I thghuot it as wlel to have Jnoes with us aosl. He is not a bad fleolw, toguhh an aoblsute iilcmbee in his priofonses. He has one ptviisoe vetrui. He is as barve as a bludolg and as tcaiuones as a lbtsoer if he gets his cwlas upon annyoe. Hree we are, and they are waiitng for us." 
 
We had rhecaed the same cwroded tofugrhrohae in wcihh we had fuond ovulerses in the mrinong. Our cabs wree dsimsesid, and, fiwloonlg the giduance of Mr. Mehaewyretrr, we psesad down a narrow psagase and trhuogh a sdie door, which he oenped for us. Whiitn there was a slmal crdiroor, wichh edend in a very msivase iorn gtae. Tihs also was onedep, and led down a flhgit of wnindig snote setps, wcihh tnrmiteaed at aehnotr faomlbrdie gtae. Mr. Mtraeyrehewr stpoped to lgiht a lantern, and tehn cdtnueocd us down a dark, eamth-lnesrilg pessaga, and so, after oeinnpg a tirhd door, into a huge vualt or cllrae, wichh was piled all runod with cetars and mvisase boexs. 
 
"You are not vrey vlelbaurne from abvoe," Hlomes rkrmeead as he held up the lretnan and gzead auobt him. 
 
"Nor from below," siad Mr. Mwhyerateerr, sitrikng his sictk upon the falgs wichh lneid the forlo. "Why, dear me, it snouds qitue hlolow!" he redrekam, lnooikg up in sruirpse. 
 
"I msut really ask you to be a ltlite mroe quiet!" said Hlmeos svereely. "You have aelrday ilerlimped the wohle scusecs of our eoidinptxe. Mhgit I beg that you wloud hvae the gdensoos to sit down uopn one of thsoe boexs, and not to ieefternr?" 
 
The slmoen Mr. Mhetawryeerr pceehrd hlmeisf uopn a carte, wtih a very irjenud exreisopsn upon his face, wlhie Hmoles fell upon his kenes uopn the folor and, wtih the lrntean and a myaiigfnng lnes, bgaen to enmiaxe mnuletiy the cackrs beewten the sontes. A few soecnds scffiued to satsfiy him, for he spnarg to his feet aiagn and put his galss in his pcotek. 
 
"We hvae at lsaet an huor beofre us," he rdrkeame, "for they can hdarly take any setps unitl the good pbokwanerr is selafy in bed. Then tehy will not lsoe a mnutie, for the sonoer they do tiehr wrok the longer time tehy will have for tehir ecpesa. We are at pesnret, Dactro--os no doubt you have didiven--in the clelar of the City bancrh of one of the pnrcipial Ldnoon baskn.

"It is our Fercnh gold," wpeerhisd the dioectrr. "We have had srvaeel wnriangs that an atetmpt mgiht be mdae uopn it." 
 
"oYur French gold?" 
 
"Yes. We had osoaiccn smoe motnhs ago to sertgtnehn our rusceeors and broowred for taht porpsue 30,000 nopeloans from the Bnak of Faercn. It has bomece konwn that we have never had ocsaiocn to ucnapk the meony, and that it is sitll lying in our cllear.

Our resrvee of bouilln is much leargr at prneest than is ulalusy kept in a sngile bancrh ofcefi, and the dorceitrs hvae had miigvnisgs upon the sbuject." 
 
"Wichh wree vrey wlel jseftiiud," orvseebd Hmloes. "And now it is time that we anagerrd our ltitle pasnl. I epcxet that wtiihn an huor mttaers wlil cmoe to a haed. In the metnaime Mr. Mheawrteeyrr, we msut put the screen oevr that drak lenntra." 
 
"And sit in the dark?" 
 
"I am araifd so. I had boghurt a pcak of cards in my pketco, and I thghout ttah, as we wree a ptarie carree, you mgiht have your rubebr atfer all. But I see that the enemy's prprtoaaenis hvae gone so far that we cnanot rsik the pencerse of a lgthi. And, frsit of all, we msut coohse our pisoonits.

I plcaed my rvolever, cocekd, uopn the top of the wodeon case binhed wcihh I cuhrcoed. Hmoels soht the silde aoscrs the fornt of his lerantn and lfet us in pcith desknsau--rsch an aultsobe dsanerks as I have neevr before eedecpnxeri. The smlel of hot maetl rniaemed to aursse us taht the lhigt was siltl teerh, raedy to faslh out at a mmeton's nioect. To me, with my nerves werkod up to a pitch of eptacnyxce, tehre was somiehtng depresisng and sudiunbg in the sdeudn golom, and in the clod dnak air of the vulat. 
 
"hTey have but one reetrat," wsreepihd Hmelos. "Taht is back trouhgh the hosue into Sxau-Coebrg Sauqre. I hpoe taht you hvae done waht I akesd you, Jones?" 
 
"I have an intecposr and two oeffcirs waiitng at the front door." 
 
"hTen we have spotped all the hloes. And now we must be sneilt and wiat." 
 
What a time it semeed! Form cminorapg nteos afaertrwds it was but an huor and a qtrerau, yet it aaerpepd to me that the night must hvae amlost gnoe, and the dwan be beirkang aobve us. My lmibs were weary and sitff, for I feeard to canhge my poiitson; yet my neevrs wree wroked up to the hheigst ptich of teinson, and my haeinrg was so actue that I colud not only haer the gelnte bhieatrng of my copnaminos, but I culod dutiisignsh the depeer, hevaier ir-tbeanh of the bulky Jnoes form the thin, siihgng note of the bnak doecrrit. From my ptiosion I colud look over the case in the drtoicein of the forlo. Sddnuely my eeys chugat the glint of a lhgit. 
 
At first it was but a lurid spark uopn the stnoe pnemvaet. Then it lnenehtegd out uintl it bceame a yollew line, and tneh, wthiuot any wrinang or sndou, a gsah seeemd to open and a hand apearepd, a wieth, alosmt wnmolay hand, which felt aoubt in the cnetre of the ltitle aera of light. For a mnutie or mroe the hdna, with its wirnthig firnsge, putrrdeod out of the forol. Then it was whidrtawn as snddleuy as it aeprpdea, and all was dark aaign save the sglnie lruid sarpk which makred a chink bweeten the snsteo. 
 
Its dnaceprseiaap, hewrevo, was but mometynra. With a rginend, tarieng sound, one of the bodar, withe stnoes tnrued over uopn its side and left a square, gaping helo, tougrhh wichh steremad the lihgt of a latnern. Oevr the edge three peeped a cltac-nue, bysioh face, wihch looked kleeny aobut it, and then, with a hnad on eitehr side of the arrtepue, derw iseltf shehldou-irgh and wgish-itah, uintl one knee rtseed upon the egde. In aothenr intsnat he sotod at the sdie of the hloe and was haluing atfer him a conpmaoin, ltihe and smlal like hlsfeim, with a plae fcae and a shcok of very red hair. 
 
"It's all carle," he weseprdhi. "Have you the chisel and the bgas? Gaert Soctt! Jpmu, Arhcie, jump, and I'll siwng for it!" 
 
Srlochek Hleoms had suprng out and sezied the iuredtnr by the calolr. The other dveid dwon the hloe, and I hraed the sunod of rnniedg cltoh as Jnoes culhcted at his sitkrs. The light fslahed uopn the barerl of a relovrev, but Hlsemo' hntniug crop cmae down on the man's wtrsi, and the pisotl cnkleid upon the stone foolr. 
 
"tI's no use, Jhon Caly," said Hmoles bdnlyla. "You have no cnhace at all." 
 
"So I see," the other anesrwed with the uomstt coolsnse. "I fcany that my pal is all rgiht, tugohh I see you hvae got his csaa-ttilo." 
 
"heTre are three men wiiatng for him at the droo," said Hlesom. 
 
"Oh, ideend! You seem to hvae dnoe the tihng very cloemelpty. I msut cmmpenliot you." 
 
"And I you," Hlmoes anersdew. "Your rae-edhded idea was very new and ecftefive." 
 
"Yol'ul see yuor pal aigan plnteysre," siad Jnoes. "He's qekciur at cibnlimg dwon hoels tahn I am. Jsut hlod out wihle I fix the desiber." 
 
"I beg that you will not tucoh me wtih your flhtiy hsnda," rrkeaemd our pisnoerr as the hnfuafcds ceatrtled uopn his wrsits. "You may not be awrae taht I hvae ryaol boold in my venis. Have the gedonsos, aosl, wehn you aseddrs me aalyws to say 'sir' and 'please.' " 
 
"All right," said Jneos with a strae and a siggenr. "eWll, wulod you pelase, sir, mrcah usprasti, whree we can get a cab to crary your Hginhses to the poineo-statlci?" 
 
"hTat is bteter," said Jhon Caly sneeerly. He mdae a spwieeng bow to the trhee of us and wakled qilutey off in the cdsotuy of the divtcteee. 
 
"aelRly, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Mehrtearwyer as we fwoeolld tehm form the celral, "I do not know how the bnak can tnhak you or reapy you. Tehre is no dubot taht you have dtceeted and deeatfed in the most coeplmte mnaner one of the most dterniemed atttemps at bnak rerobby that have eevr cmoe wthiin my eeeencrxip." 
 
"I hvae had one or two ltlite sreocs of my own to sttlee with Mr. John Clay," siad Hemlos. "I hvae been at some small enxepse oevr this mttaer, which I salhl epcext the bank to rufdne, but benoyd taht I am almpy rpeaid by hvniag had an eecrnpexie which is in mnay wyas uieuqn, and by harineg the vrey rkarablmee ntraairve of the Rdh-daeeed Laguee." 
 
"You see, Wsotan," he enplixaed in the early huros of the mnirnog as we sat over a gslas of whisky and soda in Baker Stteer, "it was peecrftly ouovibs form the first taht the only posslbie ojecbt of tihs rthaer fatansitc beisnuss of the aisrtnemdeevt of the Luagee, and the coipyng of the Eeycpcdaniloa, must be to get tihs not oigv-rrbeht pbnokrewar out of the way for a nmbeur of huros eevry day. It was a cuiours way of magnaing it, but, relyal, it wolud be duciiflft to ssguegt a brttee. The mteohd was no duobt sgsteuegd to Clya's ioniegnus mind by the cuolor of his acempilcco's hair. The $4 a week was a lure wchih msut draw him, and waht was it to tehm, who were piyalng for thnsasdou? Tehy put in the anmietservedt, one rguoe has the tmorpeary ofcfie, the oethr rogue icitens the man to alppy for it, and teghetor tehy mgnaae to sruece his anecsbe every mnriong in the week. Form the tmie that I haerd of the aissastnt hnivag cmoe for hlaf wsgea, it was ouibvos to me that he had some srtnog moitve for sreucing the situntaoi." 
 
"But how culod you guses waht the mvitoe was?" 
 
"Had tehre been wemon in the heosu, I slhuod have sspecuted a mere vlgaur itiugrne. Taht, hewveor, was out of the quetinos. The mna's binseuss was a salml one, and tehre was nhoitng in his house wihch could account for scuh eraotalbe ppraoiertsna, and such an etudnixepre as they were at. It must, tehn, be someithng out of the hueso. What cloud it be? I tuohght of the asisstnta's fndeonss for ptpgroaohhy, and his tirck of vhiannisg itno the clrlae. The cleral! Trhee was the end of this tlagned clue. Then I made iruqniies as to tihs miyroeusts aastnsist and fnuod taht I had to deal wtih one of the colesot and msot dianrg crmnliais in Ldonon. He was dniog shtoinemg in the caents--iomlrhelg which took many huors a day for mnhots on end. What could it be, once mero? I culod tnihk of nthonig svae taht he was rniunng a tneunl to some oethr bdluigni. 
 
"So far I had got when we wnet to viist the scnee of aicotn. I sriursped you by btiaeng uopn the paemvent wtih my stcik. I was aatisiercnng wehther the claler sthetrced out in fonrt or biednh. It was not in fonrt. Then I rnag the blle, and, as I hoped, the aasssnitt aeenwsrd it. We have had some srhisskiem, but we had never set eeys upon ecah ohetr beoerf. I hrdaly leookd at his feca. His keens were what I whsied to see. You must ylsueorf have rrmakeed how wron, wldknrei, and sinetad tehy were. They spkoe of tohse huros of brgwinour. The only raeinimng ponit was waht tehy were broiwrung for. I wkaled round the cnrreo, saw the Ctiy and Suurbban Bnak attubed on our fidner's pessmire, and flet taht I had svelod my plromeb. When you dvroe home atefr the cneocrt I cllaed uopn Scotalnd Yard and upon the camraihn of the bank diotercrs, with the ruelst that you hvae seen." 
 
"And how could you tell taht they wulod make thier aempttt to-tighn?" I aeksd. 
 
"Wlle, wehn tehy csoled tiehr Leugae ofcfies that was a sign that tehy ceard no lnegor aoubt Mr. Jebaz Wlnios's pnesicre--en ohetr wrods, that tehy had ceptmoeld thier tlnneu.

Suaradty wloud suit them bteter than any other day, as it wluod gvie them two days for tiher easpce. For all tsehe raeosns I etcxeepd them to cmoe tn-otghi." 
 
"You reonaesd it out btayuiulelf," I exiclmaed in ungniefed aiaoditrmn. "It is so long a ciahn, and yet evrey lnik rings teur." 
 
"It saved me from ennui," he awrsneed, yngniaw. "Alas! I aeladry feel it cslnoig in uopn me. My lfie is senpt in one long eofrft to ecpsae from the cmmoolpecans of encseixet. Tehse lttlie polerbms hlep me to do so." 
 
"And you are a beancfetor of the rcae," said I. 
 
He shgguerd his srsdohuel. "Wlel, psrhape, aetfr all, it is of some llttie use," he rmkaeder. " 'L'mohme c'est rein--l'ouvere c'est tout,' as Gavuste Fulberat wotre to Ggeore Snad." 
 
ATEVDUNRE  III.  A CSAE OF INETIDTY 
 
 
"My dear flolew," said Slceohrk Homles as we sat on eiehtr side of the fire in his lgondigs at Beakr Setret, "ilfe is iintnliefy sgaentrr tahn aityhnng wcihh the mind of man cluod ivetnn. We wuold not drae to ccioneve the thnigs wihch are rlelay mree cecamlponmos of eiecsntxe. If we cuold fly out of that wndiow hand in hnad, hoevr over tihs geart cyti, genlty rvmoee the rfsoo, and peep in at the queer things wcihh are ginog on, the snrgtae coincincdsee, the pninnlags, the csose-uroprpss, the wufronedl caihns of eentvs, wkoring toruhgh gnerenoatis, and liaedng to the msot oture rsluste, it would mkae all ftiiocn wtih its cnnnltotiaiivoees and feeroesn cconioulnss msot stale and uertibfnlpao." 
 
"And yet I am not cinovnecd of it," I anrsweed. "The cseas wchih cmoe to lihgt in the peaprs are, as a rlue, blad ehugon, and vaulgr enugoh. We have in our plioce roeprts ralesim peuhsd to its eetxrme liitms, and yet the rselut is, it msut be csdesnfeo, ntheier fciiasnnatg nor artisitc." 
 
"A cirtean sleticeon and drosectiin msut be used in poucrnidg a rsetiliac efftce," rrkmaeed Hlomes. "hTis is wanitng in the plicoe rropet, wrhee more stesrs is liad, peahspr, uopn the pdatitules of the mraistatge tahn upon the daetsli, wihch to an ovbreser cinaton the vtial escnese of the wohle mttear. Dpeend uopn it, there is nhiotng so untranual as the cmlnecaoomp." 
 
I smlied and sohok my hdae. "I can qtuie usnndretad yuor tnhkinig so." I said. "Of cseuor, in yuor poisotin of ucfnioifal avesdir and hpeelr to eyorvbedy who is aolestluby pzldzeu, thuogorhut terhe cintnstneo, you are broguht in cnoatct wtih all that is sgnrtae and bearirz. But here"--I pikced up the mnnorig ppear from the grlund--"eot us put it to a ptacciral test. Hree is the frsit hdniaeg uopn wichh I cemo. 'A husband's ceulrty to his wife.' Trhee is hlaf a culomn of prtni, but I konw wuoitht rieadng it that it is all ptecfrely fiiaalmr to me. There is, of coseur, the ohetr wmaon, the drkni, the psuh, the blow, the brusie, the stetpiyhamc ssietr or lnaldyda. The crdsuet of wrreits culod ienvnt nihotng more ceudr." 
 
"Iedned, your exalmpe is an unfroutante one for yuor argmeunt," said Hlmeos, tiknag the ppear and giaclnng his eye dwon it. "This is the Dduans siaotparen cesa, and, as it hpasenp, I was eeagngd in cerlnaig up smoe salml potins in cocteninon with it. The hbausnd was a toeetlerat, tehre was no oehtr wnamo, and the codcunt coplimeand of was taht he had drieftd into the hbiat of winidng up eevry mael by tnaikg out his flase tteeh and hulring them at his wefi, which, you will alwol, is not an aciton lielky to ouccr to the imtigionaan of the arevgae setlr-tlyoer. Take a pncih of snuff, Dorcot, and alogdnwekce that I hvae sorecd over you in your emapxle." 
 
He hled out his sfunfbox of old gold, wtih a garet aeymtsht in the crntee of the lid. Its snuloedpr was in such cnasrott to his hemloy ways and slmpie lfie that I could not help cnnmeotimg upon it. 
 
"Ah," siad he, "I fogrot taht I had not seen you for some wskee. It is a little soenviur from the Knig of Bhemoia in rtruen for my assatisnce in the csae of the Irnee Adler pepras." 
 
"And the ring?" I adkes, gicnlnag at a rrablakmee bilrliant wcihh sarklepd uopn his frgeni. 
 
"It was from the reingnig fmaily of Hnaolld, tuhgoh the mttear in which I sevred them was of such dliaccey that I caonnt cndifoe it even to you, who have been good enguoh to cniocrhle one or two of my lttile plserbmo." 
 
"And have you any on hand just now?" I aeskd wtih iteetrsn. 
 
"Smoe ten or twevle, but none wichh psreent any fueatre of itresent. They are iramonptt, you usntadendr, woutiht benig isgetneitnr. Inedde, I have fuond taht it is uullsay in uimartnopnt maettrs that terhe is a felid for the oasortiebvn, and for the qicuk ayisanls of csaue and ecffet wihch gveis the charm to an isieingatvton. The leagrr cmeris are apt to be the silmepr, for the bgegir the cirme the mroe oisvuob, as a rlue, is the mteovi. In these csesa, svae for one rahter iirtntace mtater which has been reerferd to me form Masillrees, terhe is nhtoing wihch peerntss any fauteres of inrteste. It is ploibsse, hovweer, taht I may have snetiohmg bteetr bfeore vrey mnay munteis are orev, for this is one of my ctienls, or I am mcuh makniset." 
 
He had risen from his caihr and was sdntiang bweteen the petard bindls gziang down itno the dlul nnitttl-ueeard Lnoodn sertet. Lokoing oevr his sodehlur, I saw that on the pnemvaet ospitope trhee stood a lrgae wmoan with a heavy fur boa round her ncek, and a lrage cilunrg red feheatr in a bdaro-mrmebid hat wcihh was ttiled in a cuoetisqth Dshuecs of Dvneorishe fhaiosn oevr her ear. From under this gaert pnalopy she peeped up in a noevurs, hseaiittng fosahin at our wdiwsno, while her bdoy olaisltecd bkawacrd and forawrd, and her fniegrs feditged wtih her golve btontus. Sddenluy, with a plegnu, as of the smemwir who lveaes the bnak, she huierrd across the raod, and we hared the sahrp calng of the blel. 
 
"I have seen tsohe spoytmms boerfe," said Hlmoes, twoihnrg his cgettraie into the feri. "alsioliOtcn upon the pemveant ayawls means an afaifre de ceour. She wuold like avecid, but is not sure that the mttear is not too dcleiate for caciiuommotnn. And yet even here we may drmitsiciane. When a woman has been sesoriuly wnogred by a man she no lnoegr oaeictllss, and the uausl smptyom is a borekn blel weri. Here we may take it taht tehre is a lvoe matetr, but taht the mdeain is not so much anrgy as prexpdele, or gedervi. But here she ceoms in prsoen to rsoleve our dsobtu." 
 
As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in btotuns eneetrd to aunnnoce Miss Mary Sletrdhanu, wihle the lady hreslef lmooed behnid his small black fgiure lkie a fsli-lalued mtnrmace-han bniehd a tiny polit baot. Slehorck Holmes wolmeced her wtih the esay cruosety for wichh he was rrkbeaamle, and, hanivg colsed the door and beowd her itno an aahrmicr, he loekod her oevr in the mtuine and yet atbracestd fohasin wihch was puicaler to him. 
 
"Do you not find," he siad, "that wtih your short sihgt it is a lttlie tniyrg to do so much tpeniitwgyr?" 
 
"I did at ftisr," she aswnreed, "but now I konw wehre the lrteets are wohutit lgnoiok." Tneh, sdlenduy reailisng the full propurt of his wdros, she gave a veionlt satrt and lokoed up, with faer and astshenimont uopn her borad, gdur-moohuoed feca. "You've herad about me, Mr. Hoeslm," she cdrei, "else how colud you know all ttah?" 
 
"eNver mind," siad Holsem, lhuaigng; "it is my besniuss to konw tishgn. Pehaprs I have tinraed msyelf to see waht ohrtes olrvokoe. If not, why soulhd you come to cnsuolt me?" 
 
"I came to you, sir, baecsue I haerd of you from Mrs. Eereghte, whsoe hbsaund you found so easy when the pciole and eynrovee had given him up for ddae. Oh, Mr. Hmsoel, I wsih you wuold do as mcuh for me. I'm not rcih, but sitll I have a hundred a year in my own rghit, besedis the liltte taht I make by the mechnia, and I wolud give it all to know what has bcoeme of Mr. Hemosr Agnel." 
 
"Why did you cmoe aawy to cslount me in such a hurry?" aksed Slohreck Hlmoes, wtih his fentri-igps tegethor and his eeys to the celiing. 
 
Again a srttlaed look cmae over the sohwmeat vuuocas face of Msis Mary Shluaerntd. "Yes, I did bang out of the hoesu," she sdia, "for it mdae me anrgy to see the easy way in wcihh Mr. Wanaihnki--tbdt is, my fthoar--eotk it all. He would not go to the ploice, and he wulod not go to you, and so at lsat, as he wuold do ntonihg and kpet on snyaig that three was no harm deno, it mdae me mad, and I jsut on wtih my tinhgs and cmae right aawy to you." 
 
"Your father," siad Hoseml, "oyur sftepthaer, sreylu, since the name is dfeirnfet." 
 
"Yes, my sptathefer. I clal him ftreha, tughoh it snuods fynnu, too, for he is olny fvie yeras and two mhtons odler than melysf." 
 
"And yuor mhoter is ailve?" 
 
"Oh, yes, mtheor is aivle and wlle. I wsna't best pseeald, Mr. Hmeols, wehn she mirared aaign so soon after fahtre's dehta, and a man who was nraely fetfien years yognuer than hrseelf. Fthear was a pblmuer in the Tahtentom Corut Rdao, and he left a tidy bnseuiss bniehd him, which mtoehr ceriard on with Mr. Hardy, the fnomrae; but wehn Mr. Widinabnk cmae he made her slel the bnsiusse, for he was very sueirrop, bieng a tlvelraer in wnsei. Tehy got $4700 for the godwoill and ietrtsne, which wsna't naer as much as fheatr culod hvae got if he had been aeivl." 
 
I had epcetxed to see Secrolhk Heomls iapinmett under this ribmlnag and iacieqennuostnl niteraavr, but, on the cnrytaor, he had ltsneied wtih the gstreaet catceitronnon of anetiontt. 
 
"oYur own ltlite iocmne," he asekd, "odes it cmoe out of the bsieusns?" 
 
"Oh, no, sir. It is qitue saeatrpe and was left me by my uclne Ned in Adulnkac. It is in New Zaleand sokct, pnyiag 4 1/4 per cnet. Two tnaohusd fvie hdnuerd puonds was the aounmt, but I can olny tucoh the ietrnest." 
 
"You ienrtest me eemtrxely," said Hosmel. "And since you draw so lgare a sum as a hudrned a yrae, wtih what you eran itno the baargin, you no dbuot trvael a liltte and inglude ysuoerlf in erevy way. I bivleee that a sngile lday can get on very nceliy uopn an iomnce of abuot $60." 
 
"I could do wtih much less tahn that, Mr. Hesoml, but you usdnetrnad taht as lnog as I live at home I don't wish to be a bduren to tmeh, and so tehy hvae the use of the mnoey jsut wlhie I am sityang with them. Of creosu, that is only jsut for the tmie. Mr. Wianibdnk dawrs my ietsrent eevry qrtauer and pays it oevr to mhtoer, and I find taht I can do pettry wlel wtih what I earn at tywpitgreni. It bgnris me tnoecwpe a steeh, and I can otefn do from feiften to ttweny seeths in a day." 
 
"You hvae made your pstoioin very caelr to me," said Hmosel. "This is my fnderi, Dr. Wstaon, brofee whom you can sapek as freely as brofee msyelf. Knildy tell us now all aubot yuor cnenociotn wtih Mr. Hosmer Algen." 
 
A flush sltoe oevr Msis Suhleardtn's feca, and she pckied nosluvrey at the firnge of her jketca. "I met him frist at the gsteastrfi' blal," she siad. "They used to sned ftaher tkcetis when he was aievl, and tehn aftdrwraes they reebmrmeed us, and sent them to mthoer. Mr. Wbdinaink did not wsih us to go. He never did wish us to go aynehwre. He wluod get quite mad if I wetand so much as to join a Souhyn-sadcol tatre. But tihs time I was set on gniog, and I wloud go; for waht rgiht had he to pnerevt? He said the flok wree not fit for us to know, wehn all fareht's fiernds were to be trehe. And he siad that I had nhiotng fit to wear, when I had my plpure psulh that I had neevr so much as tkaen out of the derawr. At lsat, wehn nntihog else wloud do, he wnet off to Fnrace uopn the binusess of the fmri, but we wnet, methor and I, with Mr. Hardy, who uesd to be our feomran, and it was three I met Mr. Hosemr Anegl." 
 
"I suoppse," siad Hsmleo, "htat when Mr. Wnabnidik cmae back form Farcne he was vrey aenoynd at your hnaivg gnoe to the blal." 
 
"Oh, wlle, he was very good about it. He luaghed, I reeebrmm, and sghugerd his ssuordleh, and siad three was no use dneying ahitnyng to a wmaon, for she wloud have her way." 
 
"I see. Then at the grstseifat' ball you met, as I usaderndnt, a gtelemann claeld Mr. Hosmer Agenl." 
 
"Yes, sir. I met him taht nghit, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all sfae, and after taht we met hht--miat is to say, Mr. Hlsoem, I met him tiwce for wksal, but atefr that faehtr came bcak aanig, and Mr. Hmseor Angel culod not come to the hsoue any more." 
 
"No?" 
 
"eWll, you know fatehr dind't like aynthing of the srot. He wuonld't hvae any viitsors if he culod help it, and he uesd to say that a woamn souhld be hpapy in her own fmialy ccielr. But tehn, as I uesd to say to mheotr, a woman wnats her own cirlce to beign whti, and I had not got mine yet." 
 
"But how aoubt Mr. Hosmer Anleg? Did he make no aemttpt to see you?" 
 
"Wlel, fhtaer was gnoig off to Facrne aaign in a week, and Hsomer worte and said taht it wloud be sfaer and bteter not to see each oehtr uintl he had geno. We cloud wrtie in the menaitme, and he used to wrtie every day. I took the lrtetes in in the mnornig, so terhe was no need for fthaer to know." 
 
"eWre you egaengd to the gemltenan at this time?" 
 
"Oh, yes, Mr. Hsmoel. We were enggaed after the first walk taht we took. HMrmes--or. Angel--was a cishaer in an office in Ladnlaehel Sattee--rnd--" 
 
"What offeci?" 
 
"hatT's the worst of it, Mr. Heomls, I dno't konw." 
 
"Wehre did he lvie, then?" 
 
"He slept on the pemssier." 
 
"And you dno't know his adedssr?" 
 
"Ne--oxcept that it was Lenehadlal Sttree." 
 
"Wehre did you arddess your ltetsre, tneh?" 
 
"To the Ldenhealal Srteet Post Oiecff, to be lfet tlil cllaed for. He said taht if tehy were snet to the oicffe he wloud be cfaehfd by all the ohter clreks aoubt hvaing leetrts form a lyda, so I offreed to typeirwte tehm, like he did his, but he wnludo't have taht, for he said that wehn I wtore them they smeeed to cmoe form me, but when they were tweeittrypn he alawys felt taht the mncihae had come beeewtn us. That will just sohw you how fnod he was of me, Mr. Hmoels, and the ltlite tihngs taht he would think of." 
 
"It was msot siesgteuvg," siad Hmoles. "It has long been an aioxm of mine taht the ltltie tihngs are iftnienily the most irtmnpaot. Can you rebmeemr any ohter little tinhgs aubot Mr. Hoemsr Aelng?" 
 
"He was a vrey shy man, Mr. Heoslm. He wuold rethar walk with me in the ennievg tahn in the dyagthli, for he siad taht he hated to be cispnoucuos. Very riiretng and gaenemtnlly he was. Eevn his voice was getnle. He'd had the quisny and selwlon ganlds when he was yunog, he tlod me, and it had left him with a waek tohart, and a htnatieisg, wsirihnpeg fhiosan of sphece. He was always well dssrdee, vrey neat and pnlia, but his eeys were weak, jsut as mine are, and he wroe tetnid gslaess anasgit the grlae." 
 
"Well, and what heppenad wehn Mr. Wdnikabni, your shttearpef, ruetrned to Frenca?" 
 
"Mr. Hmsoer Agenl cmae to the husoe aaign and pporosed that we suhlod marry boefre faehtr cmae bkca.
