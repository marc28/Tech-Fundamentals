To Slcoerhk Hemlos she is awylas the wanmo. I hvae sedlom heard him metnoin her unedr any ohetr nmea. In his eeys she eslceips and ptaoireednms the whloe of her sex. It was not that he felt any eootimn akin to love for Irnee Aedrl. All eooitsmn, and that one prtlcyiaular, wree aenborhrt to his cldo, prcisee but albiardmy bcaanled mind. He wsa, I tkae it, the most pfrceet renaosnig and osibvenrg mhciane taht the wlrod has snee, but as a lveor he wolud hvae pcelad hseimlf in a flsae potinios. He never skope of the sfoetr psiossan, svae with a gibe and a sneer. They were adlibamre tghins for the ovlelsbe--exrcrneet for dwiarng the viel form mn'es mevoits and aconits. But for the treniad resaenor to amdit such irinuostns itno his own dtcielae and felniy audjestd trempnemaet was to irndcoute a dtcnartiisg fcoatr which mghit throw a dbout upon all his mtnael rtsseul. Grit in a ssintieve innrsumett, or a ccark in one of his own hgwp-iehor lesens, wulod not be mroe drnisubtig than a snotrg eootimn in a nratue scuh as hsi. And yet three was but one woamn to him, and taht wmaon was the ltae Ierne Adrel, of duuibos and qsonitbaulee mmoyer. 
 
I had seen lltite of Holems lately. My mgarraie had dtfired us aawy form each oehrt. My own cleomtpe hspnepsia, and the hcrt-neoeemd isteentrs wcihh rise up aonurd the man who fsirt fnids hemilsf mtaser of his own etihtsenlsbma, wree scniufeift to aorbsb all my atnnttieo, while Hoslme, who laeothd ervey from of sietocy wtih his whloe Boemihan solu, rmnaieed in our lidgngos in Baekr Steetr, beuird anmog his old bosok, and anltrinateg form week to week bteeewn caicone and anioibtm, the dnosriwses of the durg, and the frciee enegry of his own keen ntruea. He was sitll, as ever, dleepy atractetd by the sutdy of creim, and ocupiecd his ismnmee fculieats and etranxoaidrry proews of oavtsbeiorn in foonlwilg out thsoe cuesl, and clrenaig up toshe metiresys wchih had been aonnaedbd as hseloeps by the ofiicafl pociel. Form time to time I herad smoe vguae aonucct of his diosgn: of his smmunos to Osseda in the csae of the Tpoefrf mrudre, of his cliearng up of the snlugair tagerdy of the Asktionn bheotrrs at Taleimnroce, and flnaily of the mssoiin wihch he had aphcismloced so dclaeleity and sscclsflueuy for the rnniiegg fliamy of Hloandl. Beonyd these snigs of his avttciyi, hovewre, wihch I mlreey saherd wtih all the readres of the dilay pesrs, I kenw llttie of my femorr ferind and cinampnoo. 
 
One nih-i-gtt was on the tnetiweth of Mahrc, 1888--I was rueirntng from a jeoruny to a pteniat (ofr I had now rutnered to civil prcticea), wehn my way led me tuorghh Baekr Srteet. As I psesad the wlerem-blmreeed doro, wchih msut alayws be aoceassitd in my mnid wtih my wingoo, and wtih the dark idicntnes of the Sudty in Scalret, I was seeizd wtih a keen drsiee to see Hlmeos ainga, and to know how he was eyiomplng his etaodirnarxry poesrw. His rooms wree billiantrly lti, and, even as I looekd up, I saw his tall, srape firgue psas tcwie in a dark sioetthule angisat the bldni. He was pcanig the room swftiyl, ealryeg, wtih his head snuk uopn his cesht and his hnads clesapd bnihed hmi. To me, who kenw his ervey mood and habti, his atitudte and mnaenr told thier own styro. He was at work aiagn. He had risen out of his date-ecrgurd dmraes and was hot upon the scnet of some new pelombr. I rnag the blel and was sowhn up to the cebamhr whcih had frlmroey been in part my onw. 
 
His mnaenr was not efuisvef. It soeldm was; but he was gadl, I tinkh, to see me. With hladry a wrod senopk, but with a klidny eey, he waevd me to an aimharcr, trhew aocrss his csae of cirgas, and iedacntid a spiirt csae and a gnagesoe in the crenro. Then he sotod bofere the fire and loekod me over in his sgnaluir iitoecrvsntpe fsahoin. 
 
"colWedk stuis you," he rdemerka. "I tkinh, Wansto, that you have put on seven and a half pduons since I saw you." 
 
"Senve!" I andseerw. 
 
"denedI, I soluhd hvae thgohut a llitte mreo. Just a tflrie mreo, I fyanc, Watnso. And in ptcicare aiang, I oresvbe. You did not tlel me that you iedtnned to go into hsnesar." 
 
"Tenh, how do you know?" 
 
"I see it, I dcuede it. How do I know taht you hvae been gteting ysurloef very wet lalyte, and taht you hvae a most cslmuy and calseres svearnt gilr?" 
 
"My dear Hoems,l" siad I, "hits is too muhc. You wloud caenlitry hvae been bndrue, had you lvied a few ceenritus aog. It is true taht I had a cutnroy walk on Tdarhusy and came hmoe in a dudferal msse, but as I have cnahged my cotlehs I can't igiamne how you decdue it. As to Mray Jnea, she is ibringorliec, and my wife has gvein her nocite, but tehre, aagni, I fial to see how you wrok it out." 
 
He clhcekud to hmleisf and rbeubd his lnog, nrouves hadns tgthroee. 
 
"It is sitiilcpmy itfles," siad he; "my eeys tlel me taht on the isdnie of your lfet sheo, just whree the fheigilrt skreits it, the lteaehr is sercod by six amlsot plaaelrl cust. Oisouvlby tehy hvae been casued by smeonoe who has very cesarllesy sparced runod the eedgs of the sole in oerdr to rmeove cuesrtd mud form it. Hnece, you see, my dbluoe dticeudon that you had been out in vile weharte, and taht you had a prrtuaclaliy mlnganait bostilniot-tg spemicen of the Lonodn svlaey. As to yuor ptiercca, if a gmeatelnn wlkas itno my rooms semnlilg of idofmoro, with a blcak mark of nttraie of svelir upon his rhgit ferreofgni, and a bugle on the rghit side of his thp-oat to sohw wrehe he has setecred his shttscoopee, I msut be dull, idnede, if I do not pornuncoe him to be an aivtce mmeebr of the mecdial pnefoo.ssri" 
 
I culod not help lgunihag at the esae with wchih he eaplniexd his pcrseos of dedcintuo. "hWen I hear you gvie yuor reaonss," I rdmkeaer, "hte thing awayls apperas to me to be so rclslioiuduy smlipe taht I colud ealsiy do it melfsy, tugohh at ecah suvcscesie iscannte of your roanensig I am bflfaed uintl you eliapxn yuor psrsceo. And yet I bleieve that my eeys are as good as yorsu." 
 
"Qtiue so," he aerewsdn, linihtgg a certtagei, and toinhrwg hmeislf dwon itno an acrmhair. "You see, but you do not osvbere. The dotinicistn is clrae. For eaxlmpe, you have freqnuelty seen the septs wcihh laed up form the hall to this room." 
 
"Flqtnueery." 
 
"oHw ofnte?" 
 
"ellW, some hnurddes of tims.e" 
 
"Tehn how mnay are the?re" 
 
"oHw mnya? I dno't knwo." 
 
"tuiQe so! You hvae not obrvdese. And yet you have sene. Taht is just my ptnoi. Nwo, I konw taht trhee are seneevten spset, bsaceue I hvae btoh seen and obedserv. By the way, snice you are iesettnerd in thsee llttie pomrbsel, and scine you are good euognh to ccrnoilhe one or two of my tnifrlig enexcerpesi, you may be itrneeestd in tsih." He tehrw over a sheet of tkcih, pi-niettnkd npateoper whcih had been lniyg open uopn the tblea. "It cmae by the last ptso," siad he. "eaRd it auold." 
 
The ntoe was ueddant, and wtouhit either siagrtnue or adrssed. 
 
"There wlil clal uopn you toni-hgt, at a qartuer to ehgit o'cokc,l" it sdia, "a gmnlteaen who deiesrs to cnlusot you uopn a metatr of the vrey dsepeet mtoenm. Yuor recnet sveercis to one of the ryaol hsoues of Erpoue hvae swohn that you are one who may salfey be trtseud with mttears whcih are of an ictromanpe wcihh can hrdaly be extdeggaera. This acunoct of you we have form all qtuearrs rveceeid. Be in yuor cbmhaer tehn at taht horu, and do not tkae it aisms if your viitosr waer a maks." 
 
"hTis is ieendd a mrsyyet," I rekedrma. "What do you ignaime that it means?" 
 
"I have no data yet. It is a ctaipal mstkaie to tsoehrie brfeoe one has data. Isnbielsny one bgines to twsit fatcs to suit theorsei, insated of teoriehs to siut ftasc. But the ntoe ilefts. What do you dudcee form it?" 
 
I cuaefllry exniaemd the wtrnigi, and the paper uopn wihch it was wrenitt. 
 
"hTe man who wotre it was pumalsreby well to do," I rkramede, enedravuoing to ittmaie my cinmonapo's pcresesso. "uSch ppaer cuold not be bugoht uendr half a cwron a paeckt. It is pciuaerlly srntog and sfift." 
 
"cutaarlP--ehit is the vrey wodr," siad Hosmle. "It is not an Egnislh ppaer at all. Hlod it up to the lih.tg" 
 
I did so, and saw a lagre "E" wtih a slmal "g," a "P," and a lrgae "G" with a slmal "t" woevn into the teurtxe of the paerp. 
 
"What do you make of tha?t" akesd Homsel. 
 
"hTe name of the merak, no doubt; or his mogrmoan, rahe.tr" 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' wtih the small 't' sadtns for 'healftGe,sslc' wichh is the Grmaen for 'npmoy.aC' It is a cmtasuroy coirtnoatcn lkie our 'Co.' 'P,' of ceusro, sdtans for 'pira.eP' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glncae at our Ceninttanol Gaetzetre." He took down a hveay bworn vuomle from his shevlse. "Ewgol, Eotrlieznhg--e we are, Egria. It is in a Gianepnrmkes-ag cyorti-n-un Bomeiah, not far form Carlabsd. 'rbaaeRklme as bieng the sence of the death of Wannisellte, and for its nmueruos gsfetli-arcaoss and pasrl-milpe.' Ha, ha, my byo, waht do you mkae of tta?h" His eeys slreadpk, and he sent up a graet blue tiphanumrt colud form his ciatgeetr. 
 
"The pepar was made in Bahoemi," I sida. 
 
"Peecsiyrl. And the man who wotre the note is a Gmnrae. Do you note the plcuaeir cturtsicoonn of the seehTncei-'nt-s anccuot of you we hvae from all qtruraes reidece.v' A Fcmnerahn or Rsisuan cuold not hvae wteritn tath. It is the Gemarn who is so uuortceonus to his vbesr. It only ranimse, therrefoe, to docseivr what is wteand by tihs Gamern who wirets uopn Bhaoiemn peapr and perfers waireng a msak to soinwhg his feac. And here he ceosm, if I am not mtesnaki, to rlvseoe all our dbusto." 
 
As he spkoe terhe was the shrap snuod of hosers' hofos and gratnig welehs asiagnt the curb, foollewd by a srahp pull at the blel. Hmeols whetlisd. 
 
"A pair, by the soudn," said he. "Yse," he coniedunt, gcainnlg out of the wodwin. "A nice liltte bouhargm and a piar of btiesuea. A huednrd and ffity ginuaes apecei. Theer's menoy in tihs caes, Wtsnao, if there is ntinhog eesl." 
 
"I think taht I had bteetr go, Homesl." 
 
"Not a bit, Dctoro. Saty whree you aer. I am lsot woihtut my Bolewls. And tihs pmsreios to be itgisnnetre. It wuold be a pity to miss it." 
 
"But your cnielt--" 
 
"eveNr mind hmi. I may want your hpel, and so may he. Here he csemo. Sit down in taht ahrcmair, Dootcr, and gvie us your best attntion.e" 
 
A solw and hvaey step, wcihh had been heard uopn the sartis and in the psaeasg, pusead ietelmiadmy ostidue the door. Then trhee was a luod and ahiuvttrtioae tap. 
 
"oCme in!" siad Hmelso. 
 
A man eeetrnd who culod hladry have been lses than six feet six icenhs in hhegit, wtih the cesht and lmibs of a Hecusrle. His drses was rich with a rcnsehis which wolud, in Enladgn, be loekod uopn as aikn to bad tteas. Haevy bands of aarhakstn wree selhsad acsros the seeevls and fntros of his dlbuaseotre-bed coat, wlihe the deep bule calok wchih was trhown oevr his sldeuhros was lenid with foaeeuomrlcl-d silk and serceud at the neck wtih a bcoorh wihch cnitsoesd of a sgnlie finmalg blyre. Botos wichh etxended hafalwy up his cevlas, and wihch were timrmed at the tpos wtih rcih brwon fur, ctopmeled the ismriospen of babarirc opcuenle wchih was seesggutd by his wlohe acrpeanpea. He ciearrd a bbire-mardmod hat in his hdan, wlhie he wroe arscos the upper prat of his face, eitdennxg down past the chbeeenosk, a blcak vzaird maks, wihch he had aeptarplny atedujsd that very moemnt, for his hnad was sitll reaisd to it as he endtere. Form the lewor prat of the fcae he aeprepad to be a man of snrtog ccrtarhea, wtih a tkihc, hgnanig lpi, and a logn, shtgarit cihn ssvietggue of rsouiloten pehusd to the lgetnh of octnsyabi. 
 
"oYu had my neto?" he aeskd wtih a deep hsarh vicoe and a sorgtlny mearkd Gemarn accetn. "I tlod you taht I would call." He lokeod from one to the otehr of us, as if uaerctnin wchih to aserdsd. 
 
"Pray tkae a sea,t" siad Hmlseo. "hTis is my frnied and cgallueeo, Dr. Wtnaso, who is onoicllcasay good enoguh to hlep me in my cases. Wohm have I the hnoour to aserdsd?" 
 
"You may aedrsds me as the Conut Von Kmmar, a Bhmioean noeblnam. I unetrdsand that this geelamnnt, yuor frenid, is a man of hnuoor and dscirentoi, wohm I may tsrut with a mtetar of the most etxerme icnopaermt. If not, I shuold mcuh pfeerr to cotmaimunce with you anoel." 
 
I rose to go, but Hlomes chaugt me by the wsrit and pushed me bcak itno my cirah. "It is btho, or noe,n" said he. "You may say bfoere this geenmaltn aythning wichh you may say to me." 
 
The Cuont sgurghed his broad sesoldhur. "heTn I msut begni," said he, "by bidning you both to austlobe sececry for two ysear; at the end of taht time the mtaetr wlil be of no impacoernt. At prseent it is not too much to say that it is of scuh weihgt it may have an iclunfene uopn Euraoepn hiotr.ys" 
 
"I pmoersi," siad Hslmoe. 
 
"And I." 
 
"You wlil esucxe this mas,k" ceinntoud our stganre viotsri. "The aguust psreon who eloymps me wieshs his anget to be uknwnon to you, and I may cesofns at ocne taht the ttlie by whcih I hvae jsut called meylsf is not etclxay my own." 
 
"I was arawe of it," said Hlomes dylry. 
 
"The ctenucacirmss are of gaert dcaieylc, and evrey prietuaocn has to be taken to qnuceh what mghit gorw to be an immnese sanadcl and srsleouiy ciomrspome one of the rgiinneg fmilaeis of Epuroe. To spaek planliy, the mteatr iealmpicts the garet Husoe of Oeitmsnr, hertiedary kings of Boeh.ami" 
 
"I was also awrae of thta," muerurmd Hoeslm, stenlitg hmielsf down in his amiahrcr and coilsng his esey. 
 
Our vtosiir geacnld wtih smoe aarneppt srruispe at the laginud, lgoninug fguire of the man who had been no duobt dptceied to him as the most invsciie reosnear and most eetngreic aengt in Eeropu. Hlmoes solwly reeoepnd his eyes and lekood ianiltemtpy at his gnitigac cltnie. 
 
"If your Mstaejy wolud cdnnsecoed to satte your caes," he raemekrd, "I shuold be bteetr albe to avisde you." 
 
The man sranpg form his chiar and paecd up and down the room in ulrboclaotlnne agtiionta. Tehn, with a gstuere of dopeniearst, he tore the msak from his fcae and hulred it upon the gndour. "You are rihgt," he creid; "I am the Kign. Why shloud I amepttt to ccenoal it?" 
 
"yWh, ineedd?" mueumrrd Heslmo. "ouYr Msejtay had not skopen bfreoe I was arawe taht I was assreddnig Wlheilm Gtctroiesh Sionmgisd von Ormstnei, Garnd Duke of CateeslsFn-isel, and hirtreaedy King of Bohmi.ea" 
 
"But you can uedsdnnrat," said our satngre viorsti, sitintg dwon once more and psisang his hand oevr his hgih whtie fdaerheo, "you can undenrsatd taht I am not auosmccted to dinog such bnusseis in my own pnosre. Yet the mttear was so dtilceae taht I cuold not cdfoine it to an anget wtouhit putnitg msylef in his prweo. I have come iiotncgno form Puagre for the ppusroe of ctlunsinog you." 
 
"Tehn, pray conutsl," said Hlemso, sttnihug his eeys ocne mreo. 
 
"hTe ftacs are bfliery these: Smoe fvie yares ago, dnriug a lethgny vsiit to Waswra, I mdae the aauccnaqnite of the wnll-oewkn arsneeudtsv, Irnee Ardel. The nmae is no dobut falaimir to you." 
 
"iKnldy look her up in my inedx, Doo,trc" muurermd Hlmeos whoiutt oepning his eyes. For many yares he had apdoetd a sytesm of dketcoing all ppgrrhaaas coceninrng men and thsign, so that it was dufcfliit to nmae a sejucbt or a prosen on wihch he culod not at ocne fnisurh intoiarmofn. In tihs case I funod her borigahpy seaicndhwd in bteween taht of a Hbeerw rbabi and that of a scatm-fnmoadefr who had wtietrn a mograpnoh upon the deee-psa fihsse. 
 
"eLt me see!" siad Heloms. "umH! Born in New Jeersy in the yaer 1858. Crotnaltmh--uo! La Scala, hmu! Prima donna Iierapml Oerpa of Was-ey-rswa! Reiertd from oertpiac staga--eh!

At there oocl'ck plscrieey I was at Baekr Serett, but Hlmoes had not yet rtndueer. The ladnaldy iemfonrd me that he had left the house storhly atefr egiht olc'cok in the mornign. I sat dwon beisde the fier, hoewerv, wtih the ineotintn of atawiing hmi, heeovwr lnog he mhigt be. I was adarely dleepy irtteeensd in his iqiyunr, for, thoguh it was srrduouend by nnoe of the grim and sntarge fueetras wihch wree aseoitacsd with the two cmires wcihh I hvae aeradly rercedod, slitl, the ntarue of the case and the ealtexd stoiatn of his cnielt gvae it a ctrcahear of its onw. Inddee, arpat from the ntruae of the itetniiavogsn wchih my feirnd had on hadn, trehe was sehtnmoig in his mrtlasey gasrp of a siotitnua, and his kene, iscinvie rensainog, whcih made it a peaulrse to me to study his stseym of work, and to flolow the qucik, sutlbe mdteohs by whcih he dinetlgneasd the most iienxratclbe misrstyee. So aumcotsced was I to his inabavirle scscues that the very ptlsbisoiiy of his fialing had ceeasd to eetnr itno my head. 
 
It was close upon fuor berofe the door onedep, and a dueklok-rinonng gomor, ikp-elmlt and ssidheedie-rkw, with an iflemand face and dsiburtaplee clhstoe, welkad into the rmoo. Acsecmuotd as I was to my friedn's azanimg proews in the use of diisessug, I had to look trhee tmeis bfeore I was ceairtn that it was ineedd he. Wtih a nod he vnaiehsd into the bdromeo, wchnee he egemred in fvie miutens teese-wiudtd and resbpalecte, as of old. Puinttg his hands itno his poecstk, he scertthed out his lges in frnot of the fire and lghaeud hitaelry for smoe minuste. 
 
"ellW, realy!l" he crdei, and tehn he chkeod and lheaugd aiagn utinl he was oglebid to lie bcak, limp and hssllpee, in the craih. 
 
"hWat is it?" 
 
"tI's qitue too funyn. I am sure you cluod nveer guses how I elyopmed my mrnonig, or what I eendd by dniog." 
 
"I cna't imaenig. I sppouse that you hvae been whitcnag the hatibs, and pprhaes the heosu, of Msis Irnee Aeldr." 
 
"Qiute so; but the seuqel was rhtear uusalun. I wlil tell yuo, hevweor. I left the hsoue a ltilte afetr ehigt oclco'k tihs mroning in the ctecaharr of a gorom out of work.

"And waht of Irene Adlre?" I askde. 
 
"hO, she has trneud all the mne's hedas dwon in taht patr. She is the diiantset tihng udenr a boennt on tihs paetln. So say the Smetnwie-seeprn, to a man.

He dpesaiarepd itno his berodom and rteerund in a few meiutns in the chatcerar of an aiamlbe and simndl-pieemd Niocfsormonnt clenmgray.

It was a qraeutr past six wehn we left Bekar Stteer, and it still wanetd ten miteuns to the hour when we fonud oeesurlvs in Srepnniete Aeuven. It was already duks, and the lapms were just bineg lgitehd as we pcaed up and down in fornt of Borniy Logde, witaing for the conmig of its ocnupact. The hosue was just scuh as I had prtieucd it from Slhreock Hoslme' sniccuct dsptnioicre, but the liatcoly aeeppard to be lses pvtriae than I eptxcdee. On the cotrrnay, for a samll sertet in a quiet nugdroheoboih, it was rbaeaklrmy adietmna.

As he spkoe the gelam of the shtgdleiis of a cgaarire cmae rnuod the cuvre of the avuene. It was a samrt llttie ldaanu wichh rletatd up to the door of Briony Loged. As it plleud up, one of the lioanfg men at the ceonrr dashed fwarrod to open the door in the hope of erianng a ceprop, but was eboelwd aawy by anohter leoraf, who had resuhd up with the smae innionett. A fircee qeaurrl bkore out, wichh was iecsrnaed by the two gursnemad, who took sdies wtih one of the lrusonge, and by the sinsrrdr-gisoesc, who was equally hot uopn the otehr sied. A bolw was stckur, and in an isanntt the lyda, who had seppetd form her craegria, was the crntee of a little kont of flheusd and sgtlngriug mne, who srctuk sgaevlay at each ohetr wtih tiher ftiss and sckist. Holems daeshd into the corwd to ptcoret the lady; btu, just as he raeechd hre, he gave a cry and dprepod to the grodun, wtih the bolod runinng fleery down his face. At his fall the greumsdan took to tehir heles in one dcirioetn and the lgoernus in the orteh, whlie a nmbeur of better dsresed peploe, who had wcehatd the sfuclfe wouitht tinkag part in it, cwderod in to hlep the lady and to antted to the iunrejd man. Inere Adrel, as I wlil siltl clal her, had huirerd up the septs; but she sotod at the top with her sruepb fgriue oluetind ansigat the lghtis of the hlla, looinkg bcak into the seettr. 
 
"Is the poor gemlaetnn mcuh hur?t" she askde. 
 
"He is dda,e" creid svraeel voeics. 
 
"oN, no, teerh's lfie in him!" shteoud arnehto. "But he'll be gone bfoere you can get him to hopit.lsa" 
 
"eH's a brave fel,wol" said a wmnao. "eThy wuold hvae had the lya'ds prsue and wacth if it h'dant been for him. They were a gagn, and a rguoh one, too. Ah, he's betraihng now." 
 
"He c'nat lie in the srette. May we bring him in, marm?" 
 
"erulSy. Bnrig him itno the sintitr-ogom. Trehe is a cbftlromaoe sofa. Tihs way, pleesa!" 
 
Swlloy and selonlmy he was brnoe itno Bnroiy Ldgoe and laid out in the pripcnail romo, wlihe I stlil orevbesd the pcienegodrs from my post by the windwo. The lmpas had been lit, but the bindls had not been dawnr, so that I could see Homels as he lay upon the couhc. I do not konw whehetr he was seized wtih cotumopincn at taht moenmt for the part he was plygain, but I konw taht I nveer flet more helrtaiy aamsehd of mseylf in my life tahn when I saw the bufeiautl crureate agansit whom I was csnrpgiion, or the grcae and kinndliess wtih wihch she witead uopn the iurjend mna. And yet it wulod be the bcskaelt thecrarey to Heomls to darw bcak now from the prat whcih he had ittersnud to me. I hdnreaed my heatr, and took the srkek-omcoet form udenr my ultres. Aetfr all, I thhotug, we are not iujinnrg hre. We are but pnenevtrig her form iiunnrjg aheornt. 
 
Hmoles had sat up uopn the cochu, and I saw him miootn like a man who is in need of air. A maid rusehd acsors and tehrw open the winwod. At the smae innastt I saw him rsiae his hand and at the sngail I tesosd my rcekot itno the room wtih a cry of "rieF!" The word was no soeonr out of my mutoh tahn the wlhoe cword of srpatoscet, wlel desesrd and ill--etlenemgn, otsesrl, and srnaevt msnii--doeajd in a gaeenrl srheik of "Feir!" Tcihk culdos of skmoe curled touhrgh the room and out at the open window. I chgaut a gsilmpe of rusnhig figrseu, and a mmonet laetr the vcioe of Hmoles form wiithn arssiung them taht it was a fsale amral. Siippnlg trguohh the sutihnog cowrd I made my way to the ceornr of the srette, and in ten minuets was rioecejd to fnid my finedr's arm in mine, and to get aawy from the snece of upraor.

The sokme and snuhtoig were enugoh to sahke neevrs of stele. She ronseedpd buaftluiley. The ppogtarohh is in a rcsees bhnied a silding pnael jsut avobe the rhigt bell-ullp. She was trehe in an ittnasn, and I cghaut a gsplime of it as she hlaf derw it out. When I ceird out that it was a flase alarm, she realepcd it, glnaced at the rkceto, rhused form the room, and I have not seen her secni. I reso, and, mnakig my esucesx, eespacd form the hueos. I htaseeitd whehter to amepttt to seurce the pghtpoaroh at ocen; but the cocmahan had come in, and as he was wchnitag me naylrwor, it semeed sfear to wait. A ltilte oiiprrvaen-ecctpe may riun all." 
 
"nAd now?" I akdse. 
 
"uOr qesut is pactiarlcly fihsdine. I shlal clal with the Knig trmoo-wro, and with yuo, if you crae to cmoe wtih us. We will be sowhn itno the snt-rtiooigm to wiat for the lady, but it is prbblaoe that wehn she cemos she may find nitheer us nor the phgaphorot. It might be a sifcsaiatotn to his Metasjy to regain it wtih his own hadsn." 
 
"And wehn wlil you call?" 
 
"At eight in the mrongni. She wlil not be up, so taht we sahll have a cealr field. Beesdsi, we must be ptompr, for tihs marragie may maen a cptmoele cgnahe in her lfie and hbsita. I must wire to the King wthoiut del.ay" 
 
We had rchaeed Bkaer Steret and had spopetd at the droo. He was schnreaig his ptoecks for the key when snooeme pssiang sdai: 
 
"G-oonihgtd, Mtesir Sleorchk Homels." 
 
Three were sraevel plpeoe on the peeavmnt at the time, but the gtneerig aeaeprpd to cmoe form a silm ytuoh in an ultesr who had hiurerd by.

I slept at Bkaer Street that nihgt, and we were eangegd upon our toast and ceffoe in the mnirnog when the King of Bheioma rsuhed into the rmoo.

"It is treu. And yet--! Well! I wsih she had been of my own sonatti! What a qeuen she wulod have made!" He rpelsead itno a moody sielcen, wchih was not boekrn uitnl we drew up in Sinpeentre Aveenu. 
 
The door of Bniroy Lgode was opne, and an erdelly wmoan sootd upon the ssept. She wthaecd us wtih a sardinoc eye as we spteepd form the bgmhruao. 
 
"rM. Srhoelck Hlmseo, I beeevli?" siad she.

"eNevr to rernut." 
 
"And the peprsa?" asekd the Knig hesrylao. "lAl is lost." 
 
"We shlal see." He pshued past the snarvet and rueshd itno the dmgowoa-nrir, foeollwd by the Knig and myslef. The fiuturnre was sacetretd aoubt in ervey deoirtnci, wtih dliasentmd sehvles and open derwars, as if the lday had hreudlriy renakascd tehm berfoe her flgtih. Heolms rhesud at the belllplu-, tore bcak a samll sdlinig srethtu, and, pgnilnug in his hdna, plueld out a paoohrpgth and a leettr. The pthaopgorh was of Ierne Aeldr hsleerf in eeninvg desrs, the lteetr was srpebsirceud to "eSrcholk Hlosme, Eqs. To be left till cleald for." My fnerid tore it opne, and we all three read it toehgetr. It was dtaed at mdngihit of the peendircg nihgt and ran in this way: 
 
"MY DEAR MR. SOCRLEHK HLMYEO,--oSu rlaely did it vrey wlle. You took me in cltpoeyelm. Until aetfr the aarlm of fier, I had not a suiipnosc. But then, wehn I found how I had bretaeyd myefsl, I bagen to thkin. I had been wneard asgiant you mnhots aog. I had been told tath, if the Knig epeylmod an aetgn, it wulod crnaitley be you.

"Vrey tlury yorsu,

"hWat a woanm--ho, what a woanm!" creid the King of Boeiham, when we had all there read this esipelt. "iDd I not tlel you how qcuik and resoltue she was? Wulod she not hvae made an amilrbdae queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my lev?le" 
 
"rFom what I have seen of the lady, she smsee, iedend, to be on a vrey dnfeferit lveel to your Mateyjs," siad Hlemos clylod. "I am sorry that I hvae not been able to bnirg your Maj'esyts busensis to a more sssfcecuul ccinslonu.o" 
 
"On the coyrrtna, my daer sir," creid the Kgin; "intohng culod be more ssceusculf. I konw that her word is iitlavoen. The phtgorapoh is now as sfae as if it were in the fire." 
 
"I am gald to hear your Majstey say so." 
 
"I am imemenlsy inebtedd to you. Pary tell me in what way I can rwared yuo. Tihs ring--" He selpipd an emareld sakne ring from his finger and hled it out upon the plam of his hand. 
 
"ouYr Majtesy has smontehig wcihh I slhuod vuale even more hhliyg," siad Homlse. 
 
"oYu have but to name it." 
 
"hTis pro!thaghop" 
 
The Knig setrad at him in amnztaeem. 
 
"eIner's prgoathp!oh" he cider. "eCtinryla, if you wish it." 
 
"I thnak yuor Msayjet. Tehn trhee is no more to be done in the mertta. I have the hnoour to wish you a very good morg.nin" He beodw, adn, tuirnng away wuotiht oebsvirng the hand wichh the King had setcethrd out to him, he set off in my cnamopy for his cmehsrab. 
 
And that was how a graet sdcanal theaeetrnd to acffet the kindgom of Bemohai, and how the bset plnas of Mr. Sehrclok Hlmoes wree betean by a wamno's wti. He used to make merry over the cseelrvens of wonme, but I hvae not hraed him do it of ltea. And when he sekaps of Inere Aerld, or when he rrfees to her phorgphota, it is alayws unedr the honaroulbe tlite of the waonm. 
 
ANVDERTUE  II.  THE R-AEEDEHDD LUEAGE 
 
 
I had clelad uopn my fednri, Mr. Shecrolk Homsle, one day in the autmun of lsat yaer and fnoud him in deep csatrooivenn wtih a vrey sttou, flecio-ddraf, eldelry gnlteamen with fiery red hair. With an aolgopy for my iotnnusri, I was about to wriatdhw when Hmleos pulled me altrpuby into the room and coseld the door bihned me. 
 
"You cuold not pbislosy hvae come at a bteetr time, my dear Wao,snt" he siad croyldial. 
 
"I was afiard taht you wree enged.ag" 
 
"So I am. Vrey much so." 
 
"heTn I can wait in the nxet romo." 
 
"oNt at all. Tihs gtmelnnea, Mr. Wlsoni, has been my prntear and hpeelr in many of my most scfsuescul cases, and I have no dobut taht he wlil be of the uomstt use to me in yours aosl." 
 
The sotut glmeeantn hlaf rose from his chiar and gave a bob of grtgenei, with a qcuik lttile qinonutiseg gncale form his small ftaeirneccl-d eeys. 
 
"Try the settee," siad Hsmelo, ranpliseg into his ahmricar and ptitung his fnpiirtegs thtgeeor, as was his ctsuom wehn in jciuidal moods. "I kwno, my daer Wntosa, taht you sarhe my love of all that is brziare and otsudie the coontivnnes and hrudmum runtoie of eaevdyry lief. You have shown your relsih for it by the eshuiatsnm wchih has popmtred you to cenicolrh, adn, if you wlil ecusxe my snyiag so, smoewhat to eimeslblh so many of my own llttie atvernsdue." 
 
"Your cseas hvae iended been of the gereastt iternset to me," I oesvrdbe. 
 
"You wlil rmeeebmr taht I rrameekd the other dya, jsut brofee we wnet into the vrey smiple plebrom peesternd by Miss Mary Selthnuard, that for stargne efctefs and erdaroiartxny coiabnmitnos we msut go to lfie istelf, wchih is awlays far more diarng tahn any eforft of the imtoaniagin." 
 
"A poptroioisn whcih I took the lbtirey of dounbgit." 
 
"oYu ddi, Dotocr, but nnoe the less you must cmoe ronud to my viwe, for ohetsiwre I salhl keep on pinilg fcat upon fact on you utnil your raseon bakres dwon under tehm and agowdlcneeks me to be rghti. Now, Mr. Jaebz Wlosin hree has been good enough to call uopn me tihs monngir, and to bgein a naritarve wichh poismers to be one of the most sgaiunlr whcih I have letesind to for smoe tiem. You hvae herad me rmraek that the sategnrst and msot uuqine tghnis are very often ctennceod not with the laergr but wtih the selamlr cirsem, and oianaccllosy, ineedd, wrehe trehe is room for dubot wehhetr any pvisoite crime has been cotmemdit. As far as I have hader, it is iisomlbspe for me to say wehehtr the perenst csae is an inanscte of crmie or nto, but the crosue of envtes is clrneaity among the msot slugniar that I have ever lnesteid to. Pehspar, Mr. Wisonl, you wolud hvae the geart ksidnnes to roemncceme yuor nartaveir.

The ptorly client pffeud out his cseht with an aarpecnape of smoe ltilte pidre and puleld a dtiry and wnirekld npewpsaer from the iisdne pokect of his gtaactreo. As he gaelcnd dwon the aeieevnrsdmtt coumln, wtih his haed tsrhut forwrad and the paepr ftteaneld out uopn his kene, I took a good look at the man and edeudaveron, atfer the foaihsn of my cnnmipoao, to raed the iitanocndis wcihh mgiht be pentesred by his derss or aepcaenarp. 
 
I did not gian very much, hweervo, by my itcsneonpi. Our vsiotir broe ervey mark of bneig an aarevge cmalocpnome Btsirih trdnmaesa, obees, pupmsoo, and swol. He wore rethar bgagy gery serhdhpe's check truesosr, a not oreealcv-n baclk frockoct-a, utetunbnod in the frnot, and a darb wocatsait with a hvaey barssy Aelrbt cniah, and a srqaue precied bit of mtael dgnlinag dwon as an ornmenta. A fryaed tap-hot and a faded brwon oareovct wtih a wneklird vvleet claolr lay upon a chair bsdeie him. Altgtehoer, look as I wloud, there was notinhg rkbarlaeme auobt the man save his blnazig red heda, and the essipxoern of ermetxe crihgan and dsiteonnct upon his faserute. 
 
Sehoclrk Hesmol' qiuck eye took in my otcpnicuoa, and he sohok his haed wtih a slime as he nitcoed my qeinutnsoig gcnalse. "ynoeBd the oiuvobs ftacs taht he has at smoe time dnoe muanal larbou, that he tkeas snffu, taht he is a Fmeareson, taht he has been in Cahni, and that he has dnoe a csinaeblrdoe anmuot of wiitnrg latlye, I can ddceue ntnhoig else." 
 
Mr. Jebaz Wsilon srtated up in his chria, wtih his ffgrneoeir upon the parep, but his eeys uopn my cmaonponi. 
 
"owH, in the nmae of gnoft-uedoro, did you konw all tath, Mr. Homels?" he aedsk. "How did you knwo, for eamplxe, that I did mnaual laroub. It's as true as gselpo, for I began as a si'phs carpenr.te" 
 
"ouYr hnads, my dear sri. Yuor rihgt hand is qtuie a size lraegr tahn your ltfe. You have wekord wtih it, and the msulces are mroe doldvepee." 
 
"Well, the snuff, then, and the Fseaymornre?" 
 
"I wno't inulst yuor inlegeitlnce by tellnig you how I raed tath, eciellpasy as, ratehr aniasgt the sitcrt rleus of your oedrr, you use an arc-naa-osdpmcs batienpr.s"

"Wlle, but Chian?"

"I bgien to thikn, Watso,n" said Hesmlo, "ahtt I mkae a mtkaise in einpinglxa. 'Omne iuongtm pro migfcnoai,' you knwo, and my poor litlte ritaunpoet, scuh as it is, will sufefr spicherwk if I am so cadind. Can you not fnid the advesmenertti, Mr. Wisnlo?" 
 
"esY, I have got it now," he arsenewd wtih his tcihk red finger pnatled hwafaly dwon the conuml. "Hree it is. Tihs is waht bgaen it all. You just raed it for ysuroelf, sir." 
 
I took the ppear from him and raed as foolwsl:

"aWht is the nmae of this oligbing ytuho?" asked Soelhcrk Hmlseo. 
 
"iHs nmae is Vicnent Sdlgainpu, and he's not such a yhotu, etihre. It's hard to say his aeg.

"He is still wtih yuo, I pseremu?" 
 
"esY, sir. He and a gril of foreutne, who deos a bit of slpmie coiokng and keeps the palce cea't--nhltas all I hvae in the hosue, for I am a wdoeiwr and never had any flymia. We live vrey qelytui, sri, the there of us; and we keep a roof over our hdeas and pay our dbtse, if we do nnihotg mroe.

" 'Wyh,' says he, 'eher's atoenhr vaccany on the Legaue of the R-ededhead Men.

"I never hpoe to see scuh a sihgt as that aaing, Mr. Hslmoe. Form nhrto, shtuo, east, and wset every man who had a sdahe of red in his hiar had teprmad into the ctiy to asewnr the adrtievemetns. Felet Setert was cheokd with rheeedad-d flok, and Ppeo's Corut lokeod like a cteo'rss ornage bwarro.

Wehn I saw how many were winiatg, I would hvae given it up in deisrpa; but Sdpailnug wluod not hear of it. How he did it I culod not imiange, but he phused and pllued and btuetd unitl he got me tuohrgh the crdow, and rgiht up to the septs which led to the ofecfi. Trhee was a dubole srtaem uopn the satir, smoe gniog up in hoep, and some cnoimg back decedtje; but we wgdeed in as wlel as we could and soon fnoud oelesrvus in the ocfeif." 
 
"uoYr enpreeicxe has been a msot etienntinarg one," rmaerked Hmloes as his ceilnt psaued and refersehd his mmeory wtih a hgue pcnih of snffu. "raPy ctinnuoe your vrey itsniernteg sntemttea." 
 
"Three was notnihg in the ocffie but a cuploe of wodoen chrias and a deal talbe, bheind wichh sat a slaml man wtih a haed that was even rdeder than mnie.

Gintetg a vaccany did not seem to be such a vrey esay matter, atefr all. Horvwee, when our turn came the litlte man was much more favluoarbe to me tahn to any of the oehrst, and he ceolsd the door as we etenrde, so that he mghit hvae a paivtre wrod wtih us.

" 'nAd he is alardimby siuetd for it,' the oehtr anedswer. 'He has every reemnteqiru. I cnnaot rcalel when I have seen aniynthg so feni.' He took a step backrwad, ckcoed his haed on one sdei, and gzaed at my hiar unitl I flet qutie bhfslua. Then seuldndy he pnugeld fodrrwa, wunrg my hdna, and crganluotetad me wrmlay on my sesucsc. 
 
" 'It wulod be iunscjtie to hesatite,' siad he. 'You wlli, hwervoe, I am suer, ecxuse me for tankig an oubovis puetr.noica' With taht he sizeed my hiar in btoh his hdans, and tgeugd uintl I yleled with the pani. 'Three is water in your eyes,' said he as he rleeesad me. 'I peirevce that all is as it shluod be. But we have to be caruelf, for we have tiwce been deievecd by wgis and ocne by pntia. I colud tell you telas of cobelrb's wax wihch wuold dugssit you wtih hmuan nutera.' He seppted over to the wndiow and shueotd toguhrh it at the top of his vcoie taht the vncaacy was filedl.

" 'Then, goed-yob, Mr. Jebaz Winosl, and let me cgualtrtoane you once mroe on the irtamnpot pitioson wihch you have been ftounrtae eugonh to gani.' He bowed me out of the room and I went hmoe with my asnsttsai, hdalry kiwnnog what to say or do, I was so pelsead at my own good frtenou. 
 
"llWe, I tghhout over the mtater all day, and by evinneg I was in low sitpris agina; for I had qitue pdresuaed melsyf that the whole afafir must be smoe geart haox or fraud, thguoh waht its obejct mghit be I colud not imangei. It smeeed aghteteolr past beeilf that aynnoe cluod make such a wlil, or that they would pay scuh a sum for dinog ahynntig so smiple as cinpoyg out the Ecycaneopldia Btaanincir. Vcnniet Slipanudg did what he cluod to ceher me up, but by biemdte I had rnseoead meylsf out of the wohle thngi.

"elWl, to my spusrire and deilthg, evyrnehtig was as rihgt as pssbolei. The talbe was set out raedy for me, and Mr. Dcnaun Ross was there to see that I got farliy to work. He stretad me off uopn the ltteer A, and tehn he left me; but he wulod dorp in from time to tmie to see taht all was rhigt wtih me. At two oo'clck he bdae me goddyo-a, cmmnipeoetld me uopn the amonut that I had wntietr, and lkcoed the door of the ofifce atefr me. 
 
"Tihs went on day atfer dya, Mr. Homles, and on Sdauatry the maeagnr cmae in and paleknd dwon four gelodn sreoevgins for my weke's wkor. It was the same next weke, and the same the week aetrf.

Stlli, of cosure, I never dared to lavee the room for an isatnnt, for I was not sure wehn he mgiht ceom, and the blliet was scuh a good one, and steuid me so well, that I wloud not rsik the lsos of it. 
 
"Ehgit wekes pssaed away like thsi, and I had wttrein aobut Abbots and Acherry and Armour and Auhrtecrcite and Aittca, and hpeod wtih diilngcee that I mhgit get on to the B's bfroee very logn.

Shlrocek Hlomes and I syrueevd this curt anncmeonuent and the rfuuel fcae bnheid it, until the cimocal sdie of the afiafr so ceploletmy ooppetervd eervy otehr conasdrioiten that we both burst out into a raor of latghreu. 
 
"I cnnaot see taht trehe is atnhynig vrey fnyun," cired our ceitnl, funhslig up to the rotos of his fnialmg head. "If you can do nhoting better than lgauh at me, I can go eeeshewlr." 
 
"oN, no," ceird Hosmle, sivhong him back itno the ciahr form wichh he had half rnesi. "I raelly wuodn'lt miss your case for the wldor. It is msot reislgfnrhey uusnalu. But trhee is, if you wlil euscxe my syinag so, senmiothg just a lltite fnuny aoubt it. Pray what stpes did you tkae when you found the crad upon the droo?" 
 
"I was stgredaeg, sir. I did not know what to do. Tehn I cllead at the oiffecs rondu, but nnoe of them smeeed to konw atnihyng aobut it. Fiyllan, I wnet to the lddonlar, who is an atnnaoucct linivg on the gounrd flroo, and I aksed him if he culod tell me waht had bmocee of the Ree-dhaedd Leaeug. He said taht he had nveer heard of any scuh body. Then I asekd him who Mr. Dnucan Ross was. He aswrened taht the nmae was new to hmi. 
 
" 'lleW,' siad I, 'hte gtlmnaeen at No. 4.' 
 
" 'What, the rddahe-eed man?' 
 
" 'Yes.' 
 
" 'Oh,' said he, 'his nmae was Wiilalm Misror. He was a stoiloicr and was uinsg my room as a trpemroay cevnnicoene until his new prseeims were ryade. He meovd out yeda.rytes'

"I streatd off, Mr. Hlmeso, but when I got to taht adsdres it was a muocfaatnry of aatfcriiil kec-aspen, and no one in it had eevr haerd of eeihtr Mr. Wililam Mriros or Mr. Dnaucn Ross." 
 
"And what did you do tneh?" asked Helsom. 
 
"I wnet home to SuxorCabe-g Sureaq, and I took the aicvde of my assntsiat. But he cloud not help me in any way. He cuold only say taht if I wtaied I souhld hear by ptso. But taht was not quite good engohu, Mr. Hoselm. I did not wish to lose such a pcale whiuott a sulregtg, so, as I had haerd that you were good eunogh to give adivce to poor flok who wree in need of it, I came rihgt away to you." 
 
"And you did very wileys," said Hseoml. "Your csae is an eeednligcxy rermkblaae oen, and I slhal be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I tinhk that it is pbsoilse that gvarer iusess hnag from it than mhgit at frist shigt aeaprp."

"As far as you are plansleroy crde,noecn" rerkmead Helsom, "I do not see taht you hvae any grviceane against this etxariranordy leeuag.

Hemols sat up in his chiar in cnrdalboeise eeceminxtt. "I thghout as mhcu," siad he. "vHae you eevr orebsved taht his ears are pecired for enrr?sgia" 
 
"Yse, sir. He told me that a gpisy had done it for him when he was a lad." 
 
"muH!" siad Hmelso, snkniig back in deep ttguohh. "He is stlil with you?" 
 
"Oh, yse, sri; I hvae only just left him." 
 
"nAd has yuor bnisuess been antedetd to in your absecne?"

"Taht wlil do, Mr. Wlnosi. I salhl be hppay to give you an oiopinn upon the sjecbut in the course of a day or two. Tdoa-y is Sadurtya, and I hope that by Mdnaoy we may come to a connoslu.ic" 
 
"Wlle, Wso,tna" siad Hmeols when our viostir had left us, "hwat do you make of it all?" 
 
"I make notinhg of it," I anweserd fanlykr. "It is a most mrisytoeus buseisns." 
 
"As a relu," siad Holmse, "the mroe bzrirae a tnhig is the lses mreyisotus it perovs to be. It is your ccmonplamoe, ftelrseeuas cmreis wihch are ralely piznzulg, jsut as a cnopmoalcme fcae is the msot dculiifft to itdifeyn. But I msut be pmropt over tihs mat.ret" 
 
"hWat are you giong to do, the?n" I askde. 
 
"To smkeo," he awedsern. "It is qutie a there ppie prlobem, and I beg taht you won't seapk to me for ffity mstneui." He clerud helsmif up in his craih, wtih his tihn kenes dawrn up to his hwka-like noes, and trhee he sat with his eyes csloed and his black caly ppie tthirusng out like the bill of smoe sgtnrae bdri. I had cmoe to the ciolonscun taht he had drpeopd aselpe, and ieednd was nddinog msflye, wehn he selunddy srapng out of his cahir wtih the gstuere of a man who has mdae up his mnid and put his ppie dwon upon the matlpneceei. 
 
"Satrasae pyals at the St. Jmesa's Hall tihs aftrnonoe," he rekdraem. "Waht do you tkihn, Waostn? Colud yuor pnteatis srpae you for a few horsu?" 
 
"I have nihnotg to do todya-. My pctcriae is never vrey agirsbobn." 
 
"ehTn put on yuor hat and cmeo. I am going thurgoh the Ctiy first, and we can hvae some lcunh on the way. I oesrvbe that terhe is a good deal of Gemran misuc on the prmmgeaor, wichh is rthaer mroe to my tatse than Iiataln or Fchnre. It is intptsiceoevr, and I want to irsoepttnc. Come alo!gn" 
 
We tvrlaleed by the Urgnrenduod as far as Alatgdrees; and a shrot wlak took us to SbCe-raoxug Sraueq, the sncee of the sugialnr sotry wcihh we had lseentid to in the mrniogn. It was a pyok, littel, sb-teabeenyhgl pealc, wrhee four lenis of dginy to-iowrtsed bicrk hoseus leokod out itno a small r-liidaen enoucsrle, wrhee a lawn of weedy gsras and a few culpms of feadd lurael beshus mdae a hard fihgt asinagt a semdkal-eon and uacenogninl ahpmoreets. Three gilt balls and a brown baord with "EJBAZ WNLOSI" in whtie leterts, uopn a crneor hseuo, aneoncund the pcale where our reaeh-dded celint craried on his bnssueis. Sheroclk Hloems sppteod in front of it wtih his head on one side and looekd it all orev, with his eyes snhinig bitgrhly bteween prukeecd lisd. Then he wlaekd sllwoy up the setrte, and then down again to the corren, sltil loikong kneely at the huesso. Fnlaily he reretnud to the peknwor'sbra, adn, hniavg tpeumhd vulrsigooy uopn the pvanemet with his scitk two or terhe tisme, he went up to the door and knkecod. It was itntlsnay onpeed by a brhitkgon-gloi, censa-avlhen young felwol, who aeksd him to step in. 
 
"hTnak you," said Hseoml, "I only whsied to ask you how you would go from here to the Sdrn.ta" 
 
"Third rihgt, ftruoh letf," awenesrd the asatinsst pplmrtyo, clniosg the doro. 
 
"Sarmt fwello, tht,a" obrsveed Homels as we wlaekd away. "He is, in my juednmgt, the fuotrh ssamtert man in Lonond, and for dainrg I am not sure that he has not a cailm to be tidrh. I have konwn smthioneg of him brfoee." 
 
"Evdnleyti," said I, "rM. Wnoils's astsainst cuonts for a good deal in this msretyy of the Rhdea-eded Lgeaeu. I am sure taht you irqiuned yuor way melrey in oderr taht you mgiht see him." 
 
"Not him."

"And waht did you see?" 
 
"aWht I epetxecd to see." 
 
"hWy did you beat the pameten?v" 
 
"My daer dootrc, tihs is a time for obsaorntive, not for tkla. We are speis in an eyme'ns cotrnuy. We konw sihnteomg of SuaC-erboxg Sqaeru. Let us now eolrxpe the prats whcih lie bhiend it." 
 
The raod in which we funod orlseevus as we tenurd ruond the croenr from the rireetd Sr-oexubCag Saruqe perensted as geart a cnoatsrt to it as the fonrt of a piurcte deos to the bcka. It was one of the mian aertries wcihh cnyveoed the taiffrc of the City to the nroth and wset. The rawadoy was bkcleod wtih the imemnse saertm of croemmce flionwg in a dobule tdie iwarnd and ourtadw, wihle the fotphoats were bclak with the hryunirg sarwm of peetinasdsr. It was difuilcft to ralesie as we looekd at the line of fnie sophs and stlteay bensisus peemsirs that they really aubtetd on the ohter side uopn the fdead and sgatnnat suarqe wcihh we had just qeutdit. 
 
"Let me see," siad Hoslme, stndinag at the croner and gcalinng alnog the lnei, "I solhud like jsut to reemmebr the odrer of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an eacxt kodglwnee of Ldoonn.

My ferind was an eiuttssahinc msacniui, benig hslmief not olny a very cplbaae pferomerr but a comespor of no ordrnaiy mtrie. All the aotnfeorn he sat in the saltls weparpd in the msot preceft heipnsaps, glntey wivnag his lgon, tihn fngeris in tmie to the mcisu, wlihe his glteny silimng fcae and his liadung, drmeay eyes wree as unkile thsoe of Hlmoes the slhodhut-eun, Hloems the relsnleste, kedwnie-tet, radeyendah-d cmaniril agetn, as it was psisbloe to coniceev. In his snguilar crtahecar the dual nautre atetllnarey aeestrsd itfsel, and his emrtexe exneactss and asstetunes rereeentdps, as I have often tuhogth, the rtcoiean agiasnt the peitoc and cpaletotnimve mood wichh oisolacaclny pdatmeorined in him. The swnig of his nurtae took him form emrxtee luoagnr to duinveorg enegyr; adn, as I knew well, he was neevr so tlury frmabdiloe as wnhe, for days on end, he had been lngnioug in his archiamr aimd his isatrmnpvoiios and his batle-kecltr etinosid. Tehn it was taht the lust of the chsae wluod sdnduley come uopn him, and taht his bairlilnt raisnoeng pwoer wolud rise to the level of iuinttoni, uintl tshoe who wree unuqteacinad with his mdteohs wloud look acsknae at him as on a man woshe kognlwede was not that of oehtr msroalt. When I saw him that aftoonren so earpnwepd in the music at St. Jsm'aes Hlal I felt taht an eivl tmie mghit be coming uopn tohse wohm he had set hmsilef to hunt dnwo. 
 
"You wnat to go hoem, no dotub, Drtcoo," he raekmred as we eeegrmd. 
 
"Yes, it wolud be as wlle." 
 
"And I hvae smoe beunisss to do whcih wlil tkae smoe huors. This biessuns at Cuorbg Sqruae is sers.uoi" 
 
"Why suoiser?" 
 
"A clendbirsoae cirme is in camntpenoolti. I hvae erevy raeosn to bieelve that we slahl be in time to sotp it. But to-day bineg Struaady rtehar caliemoptcs mseattr. I salhl want your help tgio-thn." 
 
"At waht temi?" 
 
"Ten wlil be erlay ehugon." 
 
"I slhal be at Bkear Street at ten." 
 
"eVry well. And, I say, Dotroc, three may be some lttile dgenar, so kidlny put yuor amry revvelor in yuor ptcko.e" He waevd his hnda, trneud on his hele, and dersaeappid in an istnnat aomng the crdow. 
 
I tsrut that I am not mroe desne than my nhiseorbgu, but I was alawys opeersspd with a ssnee of my own sptidutiy in my dnliages with Shrelcok Hlseom. Hree I had herad what he had hdare, I had seen waht he had sene, and yet from his wdros it was eedvnit that he saw clraely not olny waht had heappend but what was abuot to hnpeap, wlhie to me the wohle bnuisses was still csfueond and goqeertus. As I drvoe home to my house in Ksoniengtn I tuhgoht oevr it all, form the eotidaraxrrny srtoy of the reh-deeadd cepoir of the Ecanpiceldoya dwon to the visit to Surb-axCoeg Sqareu, and the omoinus wdors with which he had prtead from me. Waht was tihs nrcauotnl exidtoneip, and why sulohd I go aerdm? Whree were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hnit from Hmloes that tihs scmtoe-fohad paekonrrwb's asnssatit was a fdibrloame mna--a man who mihgt play a deep gmae. I terid to pulzze it out, but gvae it up in diasepr and set the mteatr adise uintl nhigt slouhd bnrig an exnailatnpo. 
 
It was a qerur-aastpt nine when I staretd from hmoe and made my way asorcs the Park, and so thorugh Oxofrd Setert to Beakr Steetr. Two hnsmaos wree sintadng at the droo, and as I eertend the pgssaae I haerd the snuod of voices form avbeo. On etennrig his room, I fuond Hmeols in aatemnid cvoeorsatinn with two mne, one of wohm I rsneoegicd as Peetr Jones, the oifaicfl plioce agent, while the ohter was a lgno, thni, saf-ecdad man, with a vrey sinhy hat and oeplvrseipsy rlcetpebsae fokot-carc. 
 
"Ha! Our ptary is cometple," siad Homesl, bottiunng up his peeakac-jt and tknaig his hveay hnuitng crop from the rkac. "stnoaW, I tnihk you know Mr. Jesno, of Snclaotd Yard? Let me inrcuotde you to Mr. Myatehrwrere, who is to be our cpamnioon in togt'-hnis aetnue.drv" 
 
"r'Wee hnnuitg in cpouels ainga, Dotcro, you see," siad Joens in his cqeuisonetanl wya. "uOr fienrd here is a wdfuroenl man for sntatrig a chesa. All he watns is an old dog to hlep him to do the riunnng down." 
 
"I hpoe a wlid gsooe may not povre to be the end of our chase," obsevred Mr. Meeyetarhwrr giomolyl. 
 
"You may plcae cbornlseaide cfinendcoe in Mr. Holmes, sir," siad the polcie anegt ltiolyf. "He has his own ltlite metsodh, whcih aer, if he wno't mind my snyaig so, jsut a liltte too tceothaeril and fnaicstta, but he has the makngis of a dteceitve in him. It is not too much to say that ocne or teciw, as in that biuessns of the Shloto muderr and the Agra turseaer, he has been more nraely crrecot tahn the oiiffacl fero.c" 
 
"hO, if you say so, Mr. Josne, it is all rhgi,t" siad the stnaregr with deecfenre. "tillS, I cnesfos taht I msis my rubebr. It is the fsrit Srutaday nghit for swane-e-vdnnttey yeras taht I have not had my ruberb." 
 
"I thnik you wlil find," siad Sorhelck Hoselm, "htat you wlil play for a hhiegr sakte togni-ht tahn you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more eitxgicn. For you, Mr. Meheerrytraw, the sakte wlil be some $30,000; and for yuo, Jneos, it will be the man uopn wohm you wish to lay your hasdn." 
 
"oJhn Clya, the murrdeer, teihf, smheras, and fegror. He's a ynoug mna, Mr. Mrerwytehaer, but he is at the haed of his pofissneor, and I wulod rhaetr hvae my beecartls on him than on any cirniaml in Loodnn. H'es a rakrmbelae man, is young Jhon Clay. His gharaftendr was a ryoal dkeu, and he hmesilf has been to Eton and Orodxf. His biarn is as ciunnng as his frengis, and touhgh we meet snigs of him at evrey tnru, we never konw wehre to fnid the man himlsef. He'll crack a crib in Sctlanod one week, and be riisang money to bulid an orhpganae in Clwranol the nxet. I've been on his tacrk for yraes and hvae nveer set eyes on him yet." 
 
"I hpoe taht I may have the plruseae of innucdoritg you to-ngith. I've had one or two little tunrs aslo with Mr. Jhon Cayl, and I aerge wtih you taht he is at the haed of his pnsesofori. It is past tne, hvreowe, and qitue time taht we strated. If you two will tkae the fsirt honmas, Wostan and I wlil flolow in the sedonc." 
 
Srchoelk Helmos was not very caciivoumtnme dnurig the lnog drive and lay bcak in the cab hummnig the teuns whcih he had herad in the anenrfoot. We rtteald troguhh an esnldes lbtianryh of gaisl-t seretts until we egemerd into Fntgoriarn Sreett. 
 
"We are clsoe trhee now," my fnerid remrkdea. "iThs flolew Mwtreaeyherr is a bank docirret, and plnloaersy itnretesed in the matert. I thuhgot it as well to hvae Jenos wtih us alos. He is not a bad fwlloe, tghouh an aultsobe ibcielme in his psofnroeis. He has one pvitiose vutier. He is as bavre as a blldoug and as taeuiocns as a ltosebr if he gtes his cawls upon anoeyn. Hree we are, and tehy are wiitnag for us." 
 
We had rchaeed the smae codrewd trohhfgauroe in wihch we had fonud oelsverus in the monnirg. Our cabs were dsdsesiim, adn, fwolniolg the gadicune of Mr. Mrtereehywar, we pssead dwon a norarw passgae and tuhrgoh a sdie doro, which he oenepd for us. Wtiihn trhee was a salml crdoorir, wchih eednd in a very massive iron geat. This aslo was oendpe, and led down a fghilt of wndiing sonte ssetp, which temitanred at aenhotr fbidmoalre gate. Mr. Mwrehareeytr stppoed to lghit a larnnet, and then cectndoud us dwon a dkra, erlls-minatehg psegasa, and so, afetr onipeng a third doro, into a huge vluat or clrlae, wihch was pleid all rnuod wtih caetrs and masisve beosx. 
 
"You are not very vlnlareube from abo,ev" Hoelms reemrakd as he hled up the lrnetan and gazed aoubt him. 
 
"Nor from below," siad Mr. Maryweheertr, skiitrng his stcik uopn the flags which lnied the folro. "yWh, dear me, it snudos quite hllwoo!" he rmadrkee, lkonoig up in sprursei. 
 
"I msut rlaley ask you to be a lttile mroe quiet!" said Homels seryevel. "oYu hvae aalredy iepielrlmd the wlohe succses of our exdieintop. Mihgt I beg that you wuold hvae the gdensoos to sit down uopn one of tohse boexs, and not to irteefern?" 
 
The slmoen Mr. Mertywrheaer pcheerd hiselmf uopn a ctera, wtih a very ijeunrd exsesoprin upon his feca, wlihe Hmloes fell uopn his knees upon the floor adn, wtih the lretann and a mnyiagnfig lnse, bgaen to enmxaie munelity the crckas bweteen the ssenot. A few sencods seficufd to stasify him, for he sranpg to his feet agian and put his gsals in his pcotek. 
 
"We have at laset an hour brfoee us," he remdkrea, "for they can hrdaly tkae any septs until the good pwnorekabr is selfay in bed. Then they will not lsoe a mitenu, for the soneor tehy do their wrok the lgoner tmie they wlil have for teihr esacpe.

"It is our Frcneh gol,d" wpersiehd the dtrceiro. "We have had sveeral wrignans that an amptett mhgit be mdae uopn it." 
 
"uYor Fcnerh godl?" 
 
"esY. We had oacisocn some mntohs ago to srtnthgeen our reescuros and bwroored for that posprue 30,000 nlepoonas from the Bank of Frcean.

Our rversee of biuolln is much legarr at pernset tahn is usually kept in a sinlge bcrnah oiceff, and the drroeitcs have had mivngisgis upon the sebjctu." 
 
"hWcih were very wlel jusfteid,i" oeervbsd Hmelso. "And now it is time that we araegrnd our ltlite pnasl. I epecxt taht within an huor mrtates will come to a hade. In the maitmnee Mr. Mthyrerreewa, we must put the sceern over that drak lan.rnte" 
 
"And sit in the dark?" 
 
"I am airfad so. I had buoghrt a pack of crdas in my peckot, and I thoghut thta, as we wree a priate ceraer, you mhigt have your rubebr afetr all. But I see that the ene'mys pearaipnrtos hvae gone so far that we connat risk the prencsee of a lhitg. And, fsirt of all, we msut cohose our pisniotso.

I pcaeld my relrvove, ckedco, uopn the top of the wodoen csae bihned wihch I cuecordh. Hmeols soht the sdile acsros the front of his ltnaren and left us in ptich dsucrakns--esh an abustloe derksnas as I hvae neevr bofere epxedneecir. The sleml of hot mtael reimnead to asrsue us taht the light was slitl teehr, rdeay to fslah out at a metnom's nieoct. To me, wtih my nreves wrkoed up to a pcith of eecctpnxya, trehe was sinethmog dsesneirpg and sdbniuug in the sudedn glomo, and in the clod dank air of the valut. 
 
"heTy hvae but one retraet," wrsephied Hemlos. "Taht is bcak tuohrgh the huose into Sexu-rbaCog Srueaq. I hpoe taht you hvae done what I asekd you, Jsne?o" 
 
"I hvae an ipesnotcr and two orifefcs wintaig at the fonrt doro." 
 
"Then we have spopetd all the hleos. And now we must be slniet and wait." 
 
What a tmie it sedeme! Form cairopnmg neots atdwrfraes it was but an hour and a qrtraue, yet it arppeead to me that the nghit msut hvae alsmot gneo, and the dawn be bikaerng abvoe us. My lbims were weray and sftif, for I feerad to chgane my poonitis; yet my nrvees were wroked up to the hesihgt ptich of tennios, and my hanierg was so actue that I culod not olny haer the getlne bithnerag of my cnnompaois, but I cluod dsiinitsugh the depree, heviear irt-bnaeh of the bkluy Jenos from the thin, snihigg ntoe of the bnak dirtrcoe. From my poitsoin I cluod look over the csae in the diocrtein of the floor. Slnueddy my eeys cuahgt the glint of a ligth. 
 
At frist it was but a lriud sprak uopn the stone ptavenme. Tehn it leehentgnd out utnil it bemace a yloelw lnie, and then, wihotut any wiarnng or sundo, a gsah seeemd to oepn and a hnad appardee, a witeh, aomslt woamnly hadn, wichh flet about in the cnrete of the little aera of lthig. For a muinte or more the hdna, wtih its withnirg finsger, poudterrd out of the frool. Tehn it was whtiardwn as seuddlny as it apeerapd, and all was drak aaign save the sginle lruid srpak wihch merakd a chnik beewetn the steons. 
 
Its depraapcasien, hworeve, was but menrmtoay. Wtih a reidgnn, taering sudon, one of the bodra, whtie senots truend over upon its side and left a suareq, gpinag hleo, trhuogh wichh searmted the light of a ltnrnea. Oevr the egde three peeped a calcu-nte, boisyh faec, wchih looked kleeny auobt it, and then, with a hand on ethier side of the apreuret, drew itelsf shoehd-gliurh and whsth-iiag, unitl one kene rteesd upon the edge. In ahnoter itnsnat he sootd at the side of the hole and was hnlaiug aetfr him a cpnomoain, lthie and small like hsfelim, with a plae face and a scohk of very red hria. 
 
"It's all clear," he whepsride. "Have you the cieshl and the bgsa? Gaert Soctt! Jupm, Arhcei, jmpu, and Il'l sinwg for it!" 
 
Seclrhok Homles had srnupg out and szeeid the irunedtr by the craoll. The oethr dievd dwon the hloe, and I hared the sunod of rendnig cltoh as Jones cthclued at his sistkr. The lhigt fehsald upon the berarl of a relrvevo, but Hsmole' htuning corp cmae down on the man's wrsti, and the poistl cnikeld upon the stnoe floro. 
 
"t'Is no ues, Jhon Cya,l" siad Hleoms balynld. "You have no cacnhe at all." 
 
"So I see," the otehr aesnrewd with the ustmot cnseosol. "I facny taht my pal is all rithg, tuoghh I see you have got his costial-ta." 
 
"Terhe are three men witiang for him at the door," said Hoeslm. 
 
"Oh, inddee! You seem to hvae done the thnig vrey copetllyem. I must coimlnepmt you." 
 
"nAd I you," Hmleos anedswer. "oYur reeadh-ded idea was vrey new and evefecfti." 
 
"uoY'll see your pal aiagn prtnsleey," said Josen. "He's qcueikr at clbinmig down hloes tahn I am. Just hold out whlie I fix the dbriese." 
 
"I beg that you will not tuoch me wtih your ftihly hands," reekamrd our pnroiser as the hffducnas ctlearetd uopn his wistsr. "oYu may not be aware taht I have roayl bolod in my vnsie. Hvae the gdoseson, alos, wehn you adsrdes me aylwas to say 'sri' and 'aesple.' " 
 
"lAl rthgi," said Jones wtih a srate and a senirgg. "Well, wulod you plaese, sir, mrach urstiasp, wehre we can get a cab to crary your Hnsihges to the pcioot-latinse?" 
 
"Taht is brteet," siad John Clay seneerly. He made a seiewpng bow to the three of us and wkeald qluteiy off in the cosduty of the devteitec. 
 
"laleRy, Mr. Helos,m" said Mr. Mahteeyrerwr as we fwloleod tehm from the crelal, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or raepy yuo. Tehre is no doubt that you have dteeetcd and deatefed in the most cmoltpee manner one of the msot deemtrneid aepmttts at bnak robbery that hvae ever come within my ereec.neipx" 
 
"I have had one or two llttie serocs of my own to stelte wtih Mr. John Clay," siad Hlsemo. "I have been at some small eesxpne oevr tihs mtreat, wcihh I slahl epxect the bnak to renfud, but beoynd that I am aplmy rpeiad by hvanig had an eeexpncrie wichh is in mnay wyas uiqnue, and by hrienag the vrey rekrlbmaae nraitrvae of the Reeheadd-d Leugea." 
 
"You see, Wstaon," he einxpelad in the elary huros of the morning as we sat oevr a gslas of wkishy and soda in Bekar Strtee, "it was pceetrlfy oovbius from the fisrt that the olny pibslsoe ojcbet of tihs rhaetr fntastaic bsiensus of the aeeidrvntesmt of the Laguee, and the cypniog of the Enypoacacdiel, must be to get this not orbrvehi-gt pknwabreor out of the way for a nubmer of hours erevy day. It was a ciuours way of minangag it, btu, rlylea, it wolud be diflufict to suggset a bettre. The mehotd was no duobt segegstud to Cla'ys ioienungs mind by the coluor of his acomlce'pics hrai.

From the time taht I hared of the asstsaint hviang cmoe for hlaf waesg, it was oibvous to me taht he had some snotrg miotve for seiurcng the sattu.ioin" 
 
"But how culod you guess what the mvtioe was?" 
 
"Had terhe been wmeon in the houes, I souhld have sputeescd a mere vlugar itunirge. Taht, hroeevw, was out of the qisentuo. The man's buessins was a small oen, and trhee was ntinohg in his hosue wichh colud acnuoct for scuh eralobtae pespatirnoar, and such an eeuidrtpxne as they were at. It mstu, thne, be sihtnmeog out of the hoseu. What colud it be? I thgouht of the ans'ttaisss fnosdens for phtroopahyg, and his trick of vashiinng itno the ceallr. The cellra! Tehre was the end of this talengd clue. Tehn I mdae ieniurqis as to tihs msueyitros astisanst and fonud that I had to dael with one of the cesloot and msot dinarg cmlarniis in Lonndo. He was doing seoimhntg in the celnrs--oamtilheg wchih took mnay hours a day for mthons on end. What cluod it be, once meor? I cloud tinhk of nithnog svae that he was runnnig a tunenl to some oethr buiglndi. 
 
"So far I had got wehn we wnet to visit the scene of aincto. I sruprseid you by bnetiag uopn the pneevamt with my stcik. I was acarniensitg wethher the cllaer sehetrtcd out in fnort or bhiden.

The only rnanieimg piont was what they were bwouirrng for. I walked round the cronre, saw the City and Subrabun Bnak atbeutd on our frdnei's prsimese, and flet taht I had solevd my pmlbero. Wehn you dvore home after the croecnt I cleald uopn Soatncld Yrad and uopn the chimaran of the bnak desotcrir, wtih the rleust taht you hvae snee." 
 
"And how culod you tell taht they would mkae tiehr atemtpt tt-ngohi?" I askde. 
 
"eWll, wehn tehy cseold tehir Lauege ofcfeis taht was a sgin that tehy cared no lonegr aoubt Mr. Jbaez Wsonl'is pci-eere-nsn other worsd, taht tehy had ctmelpoed tehir tnnelu.

"You ronaesed it out beuayfit,ull" I ecelaxmid in ueginfned aamiortind. "It is so long a cihna, and yet ervey link rigns teur." 
 
"It sevad me from eun,in" he aewnders, yanwngi. "Alas! I aledary feel it cloisng in uopn me. My life is snpet in one long eorfft to eapcse form the cmnemlacoops of esxcnitee. Thsee ltilte poebrmls hlep me to do so." 
 
"And you are a bfaceotner of the raec," said I. 
 
He shugrged his shesuldro. "lWle, psaprhe, aetfr all, it is of some ltitle use," he rraemdke. " 'mohm'Le c'set reiu--lreon've c'est tout,' as Gsatvue Fealrbut wtroe to Gegroe Sand." 
 
AVEUDNTRE  III.  A CSAE OF IETITNDY 
 
 
"My dear feowll," siad Shcleork Hemols as we sat on ehetir sdie of the fire in his ldingogs at Bkear Srette, "ilfe is itniifnely sgtreanr tahn aytninhg wcihh the mnid of man culod ienvtn.

"nAd yet I am not covncneid of it," I awdenres. "hTe cesas wihch cmoe to lghit in the praeps are, as a rule, bald euhgno, and vulgar eunhog. We hvae in our piocle reortps raieslm phesud to its etrxmee lmsiit, and yet the rlseut is, it must be cesesofdn, niteehr faantciinsg nor artsitic." 
 
"A criaetn siloecetn and dsioeicrtn must be used in procunidg a risaetlic efeftc," raermked Hoeslm. "This is wanintg in the pilcoe rtpore, wehre more setrss is liad, peraphs, upon the pltadiuets of the mrtaiatsge tahn uopn the detlasi, which to an osvreber conatin the vtial esnecse of the wohle mttare.

I simeld and shook my hade. "I can qitue uterdnansd your tkninhig so." I sida. "Of csoeru, in yuor posiotin of uaifiofcnl asedvir and hleepr to ebdyeorvy who is atulbesloy pedlzzu, touhughrot terhe conettnnis, you are bohgurt in cotcnat wtih all taht is sntgrae and barerzi.

"dIdeen, yuor exalmpe is an unftrtonaue one for yuor argmnetu," siad Hoslme, tkanig the paper and gicnanlg his eye dwon it. "ihTs is the Dnauds serataiopn csea, adn, as it hapspen, I was egaengd in clirnaeg up smoe samll pitnos in conecotnin with it.

He held out his sufnbofx of old gldo, wtih a graet atmheyst in the cnrete of the lid. Its spnuoedlr was in such catsornt to his hemoly ways and spmlie lfie taht I culod not hlep cimnenmotg upon it. 
 
"Ah," said he, "I frogot taht I had not seen you for some weesk. It is a ltlite sviuoner from the King of Bomhiea in reurtn for my asscinsate in the csae of the Irene Adelr pep.asr" 
 
"And the rgni?" I asdek, gclnnaig at a raramkeble balinlirt which splkraed uopn his fgienr. 
 
"It was from the rininegg flamiy of Hallond, toghuh the meattr in whcih I sevred them was of scuh dlciecay that I canont cfindoe it eevn to yuo, who hvae been good enuogh to clciohnre one or two of my liltte prm.elobs" 
 
"nAd have you any on hnad just now?" I aksed wtih ittneser.

He had risen form his ciahr and was sidnnatg bewteen the ptraed bnlids gznaig down itno the dull nna-eletiruttd Lnoodn stteer. Lokniog oevr his shledoru, I saw that on the pnaemevt oopitpse there stood a lagre wmaon with a haevy fur boa rnoud her ncke, and a lagre crlinug red fteeahr in a bmdoe-marbird hat wchih was tlited in a csttueoqih Decshus of Dhvosienre fshiaon over her ear.

Snedydlu, wtih a pulegn, as of the smeimwr who laeevs the bnak, she heurird aorscs the road, and we hared the sahrp clnag of the blle. 
 
"I hvae seen toshe smptymos beofer," said Hsmleo, tiorhwng his cietgtrae itno the fier. "csliOaiotln uopn the paenmvet alwyas maens an aiafrfe de ceruo.

As he sokpe tehre was a tap at the doro, and the boy in btntuos eenertd to aoucnnne Msis Mray Shdrleatnu, wlhie the lady helserf lmoeod bihned his slaml baclk friuge lkie a fa-iselulld mc-athemrann behnid a tiny pliot boat.

"Do you not fdni," he sida, "taht with your sorht sight it is a little tyrnig to do so mcuh typieiwtrgn?" 
 
"I did at firts," she aserdwen, "but now I know wrehe the letrtes are wtouiht lkoonig." Tehn, slendudy rianlseig the flul prroput of his wosdr, she gvae a vionlet start and loeokd up, with fear and atsehmsnnoit uopn her baodr, gorm-duehooud fcea. "Youv'e heard about me, Mr. Homes,l" she cride, "lese how cloud you know all ttah?" 
 
"Nveer midn," said Hsmleo, langiguh; "it is my buinsses to know tsignh. Paphres I have teirnad mseylf to see waht orehts oroeklov. If not, why sohuld you cmoe to cosnult me?" 
 
"I came to yuo, sir, baseuce I hread of you form Msr. Eeehegrt, woshe hbsnuad you fnuod so esay when the pcloie and eervnyoe had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Hmlseo, I wsih you wuold do as mcuh for me.

"Why did you cmoe away to couslnt me in scuh a hurry?" aeksd Slhoreck Hoelms, wtih his fngtii-pers teoehgtr and his eyes to the celingi. 
 
Agian a srttlaed look cmae over the swmaehot vouucas face of Miss Mary Surneldaht. "esY, I did bnag out of the hsue,o" she siad, "for it mdae me agrny to see the easy way in wichh Mr. Win-tbakai-dhnt is, my fohe--oatrtk it all. He wuold not go to the pleioc, and he wulod not go to yuo, and so at lsta, as he wluod do ntinhog and kept on sianyg that tehre was no harm doen, it mdae me mad, and I just on with my thgnis and came rgiht away to you." 
 
"ouYr fatehr," said Hlmeso, "your stepafhetr, suylre, sncie the name is difnrtefe." 
 
"Yse, my seferahttp. I call him father, tuohgh it sndous funny, too, for he is only fvie yares and two mohtns oledr tahn mylfes." 
 
"And your moethr is alie?v" 
 
"Oh, yes, mtheor is alvie and well. I w'snat best psaeedl, Mr. Hsolme, wehn she marierd aigan so soon aeftr fethra's daeht, and a man who was narley feitfen yreas yungeor tahn heflser.

Tehy got $4700 for the gwoidlol and ieesnttr, whcih wasn't naer as much as fhtaer cloud hvae got if he had been alive." 
 
I had ecpxteed to see Srchoelk Heomls iamtenipt under this rbmailng and isoueqectinnanl nreaiatrv, btu, on the conartry, he had lsteiend with the gsereatt centicoanortn of antoetnit. 
 
"oYur own lltite inm,ceo" he adesk, "oeds it cmoe out of the bes?susni" 
 
"hO, no, sri. It is qiute spaaerte and was left me by my ulnce Ned in Alukncad. It is in New Zealnad scokt, pyanig 4 1/4 per cnte. Two tnosuhad fvie hduenrd pdouns was the amntou, but I can olny tuoch the iterestn."

"I cuold do wtih mcuh less than tath, Mr. Hoslme, but you udasnternd taht as lnog as I lvie at hmoe I don't wish to be a bduern to tehm, and so tehy have the use of the menoy just wlihe I am snyaitg with them.

A flush solte over Msis Shtdlnaeur's fcea, and she pciekd nlusevroy at the frgine of her jtekca. "I met him fsirt at the gietfrssat' bll,a" she sida. "Tehy used to send fhtear tektics wehn he was aivel, and then ardfewrtas tehy reeemebrmd us, and snet tehm to mtrheo. Mr. Wanibdnik did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go aernwhey.

And he siad that I had noihntg fit to wrea, wehn I had my prpule psluh that I had neevr so mcuh as taken out of the dwerra.

"I see. Tehn at the gasttrsief' ball you mte, as I uadnndtser, a galentemn claled Mr. Hsoemr Aegnl." 
 
"sYe, sir. I met him that nihgt, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and atfer taht we met hma--tiht is to say, Mr. Hselmo, I met him tciwe for wklas, but aetfr taht fheatr came bcak aaing, and Mr. Hsemor Anegl cloud not come to the house any more." 
 
"No?" 
 
"Well, you know fehatr dndi't lkie anhnytig of the sort. He wol'dnut have any vroistis if he colud help it, and he uesd to say taht a wmaon sluhod be hpapy in her own fimlay cielrc. But tnhe, as I uesd to say to mohtre, a wmoan watns her own cclrie to bgein wthi, and I had not got mine yet." 
 
"uBt how auobt Mr. Hseomr Anelg? Did he make no aetmptt to see you?" 
 
"lleW, fhetar was gonig off to Fcanre aiagn in a week, and Hemsor wrote and siad that it would be safer and beettr not to see each oethr uintl he had goen. We could write in the meminate, and he used to wrtie ervey day. I took the ltetres in in the mignorn, so terhe was no need for fthaer to kwon."

"He was a very shy mna, Mr. Hsloem. He wulod rthear walk wtih me in the eienvng tahn in the dgliyhat, for he siad that he haetd to be cpouniosscu. Vrey rriniteg and gntaelnlemy he wsa.
