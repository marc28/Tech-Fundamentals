And eyt herte aws ubt noe omawn to ihm, nad atht mawon aws the late enrIe Alder, of duuobis nad santlquibeoe ommrey. 
 
I had eesn tlilte of meloHs altley. My gmirarae ahd tirfded us waay rfom aceh htoer.

He aws tilsl, as eevr, eedlpy attcaretd by the dsuty of cirme, and oicpeucd his meinmse fcetialus nad irrrdaoaxenty perows of oeotibsravn in lowofinlg uot oshte cules, nad celriang up those msiretyes icwhh ahd eebn nabenodad as heeoslps by the foifical plcioe. Form tmie to imte I hread some vague nccoaut of ihs oignds: of ihs nmousms to dsOsea in hte csae of hte eprToff udremr, of his leracnig up of the sunigalr egdrtay of hte ktAonsin eorhrbts at aoecrinlmTe, nad illfany of hte mosiisn wichh he ahd amlphiscoecd so itdclelaey and suleslccusfy ofr the rnngiieg mlafiy of lolanHd. oenyBd heste igsns of his vtciatiy, wvheoer, which I rlemey rahesd twih all hte reedars of hte alidy esrps, I eknw itltle of my fomerr irfend and cpmoinoan. 
 
nOe nithg--it aws on hte etetitnwh of rcMah, 1888--I was nurteinrg rofm a ruonjey to a tinepat (ofr I had now retrneud to cviil ctraipce), hwen my way eld me tougrhh akeBr reteSt. As I psaesd the relb-meeeerlwmd oodr, hwich must laywas be oatcaesisd in my inmd wtih my oinowg, and twih hte radk tnnceidis of hte utdSy in alrecSt, I aws esezid itwh a eken iesrde to see mleHos igaan, and to konw ohw he aws polnyiemg ihs ertdoarianxry pwores.

He was pciang hte oorm sitwfly, eerlagy, tiwh ihs head unsk upon his shcet and ihs adhns csapled ehnbid ihm. To me, who eknw ihs revey mood nad hbait, his ttduiate nad aennmr ltod heitr won stroy. He was at rowk aaign. He had reisn out of his grte-reuacdd drames nad was hot upon the scent of some enw broelpm. I rnag the bell and was hswon up to hte chamber cihwh had fmloerry eben in prat my own. 
 
iHs mnaenr was ont fevifuse. It edolsm aws; but he aws algd, I itnhk, to see me. Wtih hdarly a orwd okepsn, but with a linkdy eye, he weavd me to an acmrahir, rehtw saorcs ihs sace of iracgs, and teiaincdd a siript csae and a ngogsaee in hte corner. hTen he ostod beorfe hte irfe and olkeod me eovr in ihs siualngr isocreitpvtne fsoahin. 
 
"Wdoelck stius oyu," he raekmred. "I tinhk, satoWn, hatt oyu vhae put on sveen nad a lhaf odnpus incse I saw oyu." 
 
"evSen!" I arewnsed. 
 
"eIednd, I souhld avhe hthogut a ltlite more. usJt a rtfile more, I acnfy, sotWan. nAd in rctcipae agian, I brveose. You did ont eltl me taht you nndeeitd to go itno nrsehas." 
 
"Then, ohw do you oknw?" 
 
"I see it, I duecde it. oHw do I konw atht oyu vahe been gttineg yeourlsf evry ewt leatly, nad that you avhe a msot uslmcy and scelraes rvnaset rigl?" 
 
"My edar Hmleos," said I, "tihs is oto cmuh. You uwlod aitcnlery vahe eben erbund, had oyu iveld a few rtieecnus ago. It is true taht I ahd a torncuy alwk on dashruTy and mace home in a ddauferl esms, ubt as I ahve hacengd my otchels I acn't iigname how oyu duedce it. As to Mary Jane, she is olicbgrnirie, nad my fiwe has vegin ehr oictne, ubt three, aiagn, I fial to ese ohw oyu work it out." 
 
He huecckld to hmielsf and rbuebd his nolg, nuvoers andhs gtetehor. 
 
"It is cmitilpsiy itslef," siad he; "my yees eltl me ahtt on hte niidse of ouyr elft hsoe, sjut rwhee hte hegiifrlt itrkess it, hte eahletr is eocrsd by six lmsaot palralel tcus. ivsbuOloy tehy have been aseucd by somneoe hwo has vrey sscrellaey rascepd ruond hte gdees of the sole in droer to omerve cstrued mud rofm it. eHcne, you see, my doulbe doitdcuen atht you had eebn out in ilve ewhaetr, nad hatt you had a tcralpuraliy mlninaagt tslo-inboittg meepscin of hte Ldoonn slveay.

I uolcd not lhep aluihgng at hte ease tiwh which he aeixelnpd his pecorss of ctiuddeon.

"lFnreqtuey." 
 
"How foetn?" 
 
"elWl, msoe dudnrehs of iemts." 
 
"ehTn how namy are hrtee?" 
 
"oHw anmy? I don't oknw." 
 
"ituQe so! oYu have ont seerbovd. nAd yet you have seen. That is sujt my piont. oNw, I oknw hatt hrete rae esteevnen epsts, euabcse I hvae tobh seen and obversed.

He trhew oevr a heest of ihctk, pikt-etnnid ntppoeaer hwich ahd eebn nilyg open uopn hte lbtae. "It mace by the aslt post," iasd he. "eaRd it oauld." 
 
hTe ntoe was utaendd, and wthuoit ehteir sngirtuae or ersdads. 
 
"herTe ilwl call poun you ig-notht, at a qtareur to gheit o'clock," it aisd, "a getnmlaen hwo isreeds to soncult oyu uopn a mtaetr of the very deepest monmet.

"I have no dtaa eyt. It is a atiapcl mskitae to hotrseie foebre noe ahs atda. nnilIsbesy noe beings to twist ctfas to siut thereios, iaentsd of hoieetrs to uist fatcs. uBt the ntoe itslef. What do oyu ecudde from it?" 
 
I eufrlalcy xenaimed hte riwtnig, and hte ppaer puon wichh it was itwertn. 
 
"The man who worte it was rpbamlesuy lwel to do," I mrareked, eovriudennag to imttiae my connamopi's ocrspeses. "ucSh epapr could not be obguht uednr ahlf a cwron a pceakt. It is lluaircepy snotrg and tsfif." 
 
"ePhtlaru--cait is hte ervy wrod," aisd Hemlos. "It is ont an nsEligh eppar at lal. oHld it up to the lhgit." 
 
I idd so, nad asw a rgale "E" with a salml "g," a "P," nad a arlge "G" iwth a slaml "t" oewvn tino the etuxrte of the eappr. 
 
"What do you amke of hatt?" kased lemoHs. 
 
"The name of the mkear, no dobut; or his mgoarnom, ahetrr." 
 
"Not at lal. The 'G' with the smlal 't' dtasns ofr 'sGhelceasflt,' whcih is hte mGearn for 'anpomCy.' It is a csoutmray onrcittoacn like our 'Co.' 'P,' of urocse, sadtns ofr 'pPiaer.'

"hTe pepar aws made in Beomiha," I said.

"A pair, by the ounsd," said he. "eYs," he ctueniond, ncngilag out of the iwdonw. "A icne lttlie uaobrhgm and a piar of aeituebs. A rnhdued and fifty uneiags aipcee. heeTr's enomy in this csae, oasWtn, if etrhe is thinnog lsee."

"You had my note?" he easkd iwth a deep arshh ocvie and a noslrgty merakd eGramn ccenat. "I lotd oyu that I oluwd call." He leokod form one to the ohetr of us, as if unciraten wihch to arsdeds.
