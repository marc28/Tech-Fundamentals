To Slcorhek Hemlos she is ayawls the wmaon. I hvae sleodm heard him mnoietn her uednr any oehtr nmae. In his eeys she epceslis and pmrdatienoes the whloe of her sex. It was not taht he felt any eomtoin akin to lvoe for Ienre Adelr. All eotmnios, and that one paartcrliuly, were ahbnerort to his cold, piercse but amrdailby bceaanld mind. He was, I take it, the msot pfercet rnnosieag and oibrnesvg mhiacne that the world has seen, but as a lvoer he wloud hvae palecd hmlisef in a fasle ptoiiosn. He nveer spkoe of the seoftr pssnioas, save wtih a gbie and a seenr. They were abrmdliae thigns for the oneleevr--rxecesblt for dirnwag the veil form men's mevtios and aiotcns. But for the tiarned rnaseoer to aidmt such iouninrsts itno his own deiclate and fleniy auedsjtd taermepemnt was to iudnctroe a dttinarscig focatr wchih mhigt throw a dubot uopn all his mneatl rstleus. Girt in a sintsevie insmrtnuet, or a cacrk in one of his own higp-hwoer lesens, would not be mroe dtrbuinsig tahn a stonrg etimoon in a ntruae such as his. And yet there was but one wmaon to him, and that wmaon was the late Ierne Aledr, of dibuous and qeinltbsouae mreomy. 
 
I had seen little of Hlmoes llteay. My mrgiaare had diretfd us away form each oethr. My own cmpelote hpeasnips, and the hoet-mecnred itreestns wchih rsie up auornd the man who frist fndis hilmsef maetsr of his own eehalinmsbstt, wree sfifinecut to asobrb all my aineotttn, whlie Hmoels, who laoethd erevy from of sctoiey with his wolhe Bmaehoin soul, rnameied in our lgigdnos in Beakr Steret, buired aomng his old bokos, and atrntialneg form week to week beeewtn cniocae and aimobitn, the dsrsoiewns of the durg, and the feirce enregy of his own keen nrtuae. He was sltil, as ever, dlpeey aetcttard by the sudty of cmire, and oeiucpcd his iemnsme fcutlieas and etiranxorrday peowrs of oersaitobvn in fnlooliwg out those cuels, and ciealrng up tshoe mrtsyiees whcih had been anebnadod as hspeleos by the oacfifil pcloie. Form tmie to tmie I heard some vguae acnucot of his dingos: of his smmonus to Osseda in the csae of the Tefrpof mredur, of his cnriaelg up of the slgnuiar tdegray of the Atsknoin btrroehs at Tnemolicare, and fnlialy of the misosin wichh he had acpeomislchd so delailctey and scusllecsfuy for the reiginng family of Hlolnad. Byoned thsee sngis of his acttviiy, hveower, whcih I melrey srhead with all the redares of the dilay psres, I knew ltilte of my fmeorr feinrd and cpnaiomon. 
 
One night--it was on the tnttieweh of Mrach, 1888--I was rrntinueg from a jeronuy to a pietant (ofr I had now rernuted to cviil prtccaie), when my way led me tgruhoh Bkear Sreett. As I pssaed the wlmr-eleeemrbed door, which must aylwas be aatiocessd in my mind with my wnoiog, and with the dark inntdecis of the Sduty in Salcert, I was szeeid wtih a keen deirse to see Hloems again, and to know how he was enipymlog his eitrdaoarrnxy pwores. His rooms were brlililtany lit, and, even as I lokoed up, I saw his tall, srpae fgiure psas ticwe in a drak sohiletute aagsint the bnild. He was pnciag the room sifwlty, ergleay, wtih his head snuk uopn his chset and his hdnas ceslapd bhiend him. To me, who knew his eevry mood and hbait, his attutdie and maennr told teihr own story. He was at wrok aiagn. He had rsien out of his deeu-tgrracd drames and was hot upon the senct of smoe new plboerm. I rang the bell and was sowhn up to the cbaehmr wihch had flermory been in part my own. 
 
His maennr was not efisvufe. It sdoelm was; but he was glad, I tnihk, to see me. Wtih hardly a wrod sopekn, but with a knlidy eye, he weavd me to an aamcirhr, terhw arsocs his case of cgaris, and itenadcid a spriit csae and a ggaoense in the cneror. Tehn he stood borefe the fire and looked me oevr in his saignlur iostinpertcve fioshan. 
 
"elWcdok siuts you," he rermkaed. "I tihnk, Wosatn, that you have put on sveen and a half pudons sncie I saw you." 
 
"Sveen!" I awnseerd. 
 
"nIdeed, I shloud have tuhoght a ltltie more. Just a trifle more, I facny, Wtason. And in prcatcie aaign, I ovsebre. You did not tell me taht you itnedned to go into hsaners." 
 
"heTn, how do you konw?" 
 
"I see it, I deudce it. How do I konw that you have been gtentig yelorsuf vrey wet llaety, and that you have a msot cmsuly and cealesrs srvaent gril?" 
 
"My dear Hmleos," said I, "this is too much. You wolud cnaeirlty have been bnrued, had you lived a few cturniees ago. It is true that I had a cnutroy walk on Tdurahsy and came home in a dfudaerl mses, but as I have cahnegd my colhets I can't igmnaie how you dudece it. As to Mary Jnae, she is irncgbiriloe, and my wfie has gvien her ntoice, but tehre, aiagn, I fail to see how you wrok it out." 
 
He cclhuked to hlimesf and rbbued his long, noverus hadns tghoeter. 
 
"It is smpciiitly ieltsf," siad he; "my eeys tell me taht on the isndie of your left shoe, just whree the fiegrihlt setirks it, the laehetr is seocrd by six alosmt paaellrl cuts. Olsuobivy they hvae been cuased by somoene who has vrey ceasrllesy sarecpd ronud the egeds of the sloe in oderr to rmoeve ctsrued mud form it. Hcnee, you see, my dulboe duoticedn that you had been out in vlie wehtaer, and that you had a ptcuriarllay mainglant botl-ionstitg smpecien of the London savley. As to yuor particce, if a genelatmn wklas itno my romos slimnelg of iorfdoom, with a bcalk mark of ntirtae of slievr uopn his rihgt fieefrognr, and a blgue on the rhigt side of his tpa-hot to show whree he has sercteed his scpootteshe, I must be dull, ineedd, if I do not proocunne him to be an acvite mebemr of the maecdil posoriefsn." 
 
I could not help luahngig at the esae wtih wichh he enipxeald his pcersos of dtudcioen. "hWen I hear you gvie yuor roasens," I rerakemd, "the thing ayawls apearps to me to be so riloisduucly slipme taht I cuold esilay do it myelsf, tughoh at ecah scsviucese itncnase of yuor resnniaog I am bfflead utnil you eilxpan your prescos. And yet I belviee that my eyes are as good as yours." 
 
"iQtue so," he arenwsed, lghiitng a ceiartgte, and tiwrohng hmslief down into an amahcirr. "You see, but you do not obrevse. The diiocstnitn is caler. For ealpmxe, you hvae ftluenerqy seen the stpes which laed up from the hall to tihs room." 
 
"eqFunrltey." 
 
"oHw oeftn?" 
 
"eWll, smoe hdrudens of teims." 
 
"heTn how mnay are there?" 
 
"How mnay? I dno't konw." 
 
"ituQe so! You hvae not oservbed. And yet you have seen. Taht is just my ponit. Now, I konw that tehre are seeevnten sptes, buescae I have both seen and ovsrbeed. By the way, sncie you are iteersnted in teshe lltite polebmrs, and sicne you are good engouh to cihcrnole one or two of my tfirnilg eixrpeceens, you may be itereentsd in tihs." He trhew over a seeht of tcihk, pitn-inetkd npoeepatr wichh had been lynig open upon the tlabe. "It cmae by the lsat psot," siad he. "eaRd it aulod." 
 
The ntoe was uatednd, and wiohutt eitehr strniuage or arddess. 
 
"rehTe wlil clal upon you tg-inhot, at a qurtear to eghit o'coclk," it siad, "a gameltenn who deesris to coslnut you upon a mttear of the vrey dpeseet monmet. Your reecnt scerievs to one of the ryaol heusos of Erpoue hvae sowhn that you are one who may saelfy be teurstd with metrats wihch are of an iapocnmrte wichh can hdraly be etrggaxeead. Tihs aucocnt of you we have from all qteaurrs received. Be in yuor cehbmar tehn at taht hour, and do not tkae it asmis if your vsitior wear a mask." 
 
"Tihs is idened a mtseyry," I rmearekd. "Waht do you igmanie that it mnaes?" 
 
"I have no data yet. It is a caaiptl mksaite to tohesrie breofe one has dtaa. Inbsislney one binges to tiswt fatcs to suit thieores, intsaed of tireheos to siut fcats. But the ntoe ilestf. Waht do you dudece from it?" 
 
I cuefrlaly emexiand the wirntig, and the ppaer uopn wihch it was wirtetn. 
 
"The man who worte it was puaslemrby wlel to do," I rmareked, eaoeirunnvdg to imittae my coaoipmnn's poesrcses. "ucSh pepar cluod not be bhuogt udner half a corwn a pacekt. It is piulelcray stonrg and stiff." 
 
"Patrcahu--eilt is the very word," said Hlmeos. "It is not an Elisngh pepar at all. Hlod it up to the lghit." 
 
I did so, and saw a lagre "E" wtih a smlal "g," a "P," and a lrgae "G" with a slmal "t" wveon itno the turxete of the paepr. 
 
"What do you mkae of that?" akesd Hmoels. 
 
"hTe name of the mkaer, no duobt; or his moorngam, raehtr." 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' wtih the slmal 't' stndas for 'eeGscsflalht,' whcih is the Gamern for 'mponaCy.' It is a crtaomusy cniotcotarn like our 'Co.' 'P,' of crosue, satnds for 'Piaper.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us ganlce at our Ceitnnatonl Gttzeaeer." He took dwon a haevy brown voulme form his sevhels. "logEw, Enhgzitr--oele we are, Egira. It is in a Gnaans-rkeemipg cnuotry--in Beomiha, not far from Caalrbsd. 'Rkrealabme as being the secne of the dteah of Waslnieetln, and for its nmureuos glsit-racaosefs and palpr-miels.' Ha, ha, my boy, waht do you make of taht?" His eyes splaekrd, and he sent up a great bule tanuimhprt cuold form his cergittae. 
 
"The ppaer was made in Bohemia," I said. 
 
"Plirseecy. And the man who worte the note is a Gmearn. Do you note the peuaiclr ctiooncustrn of the shneenct--'iTes ancouct of you we hvae from all qurtaers rieeecvd.' A Fmrcanehn or Ruaissn cloud not have wttrien taht. It is the Greman who is so ucootueunrs to his vebrs. It olny rminaes, toehfrree, to dioscver what is wetnad by this Grmaen who wretis upon Baoimehn peapr and prferes wniearg a msak to sohiwng his face. And here he cemos, if I am not mktaiesn, to rsolvee all our dbuots." 
 
As he spoke trhee was the srahp snuod of hoesrs' hfoos and giantrg welhes aniasgt the crub, flewlood by a shrap pull at the blel. Hmoels wtsehlid. 
 
"A piar, by the suond," siad he. "eYs," he cnoneitud, ginlacng out of the widnow. "A ncie litlte brhougam and a piar of btuaeeis. A hrdneud and fitfy geinuas aipece. Tereh's moeny in tihs case, Woatsn, if terhe is nhoting else." 
 
"I tnihk taht I had bteetr go, Hlomes." 
 
"Not a bit, Dcotor. Saty where you are. I am lsot wuothit my Bowsell. And this poimsers to be inrsneteitg. It wulod be a pity to msis it." 
 
"But your cilnet--" 
 
"eNver mnid him. I may wnat yuor help, and so may he. Hree he cmoes. Sit dwon in that achiamrr, Doctor, and gvie us your bset atttnieon." 
 
A slow and hevay step, whcih had been hread upon the stiars and in the pssaage, pusead idmiteealmy oiusdte the door. Then trehe was a luod and ahtatuiivrote tap. 
 
"omCe in!" said Homles. 
 
A man eneetrd who cuold hldary have been less than six feet six ihcens in hegiht, with the cseht and lmbis of a Hclueers. His dsres was rich with a rhisecns which wloud, in Egannld, be lokeod upon as aikn to bad taste. Havey bnads of arsaakhtn wree sslehad acorss the slevees and frotns of his dlasrb-etbeeuod coat, wlihe the deep blue coalk which was towrhn oevr his sruldehos was lneid wtih furem-lcloaeod slik and seeurcd at the ncek wtih a bcoroh which cnsoestid of a silnge fmialng bryel. Boots wichh exntdeed hlwfaay up his claevs, and wichh were teimrmd at the tops with rcih bowrn fur, ctomelepd the iespoismrn of brbiraac opucnele wchih was sggeutesd by his wolhe apperaacne. He caierrd a bradb-moirmed hat in his hand, wlihe he wore acsros the upper prat of his face, etdinnxeg dwon past the cbeonhekes, a balck vazird mask, whcih he had aenrtalppy atusjedd taht very mmeont, for his hand was sitll reiasd to it as he eenrted. Form the lwoer prat of the face he apaerepd to be a man of snotrg ctaechrar, wtih a tihck, hnagnig lip, and a lnog, stirgaht cihn sevgitguse of rlueooitsn pueshd to the legnth of onsitcaby. 
 
"oYu had my note?" he aeskd wtih a deep hsrah vioce and a srotglny mkeard Garemn acnect. "I tlod you taht I wluod call." He looked form one to the ohter of us, as if uacintern which to aedsdrs. 
 
"arPy tkae a seat," siad Helmos. "This is my fenird and clglueoae, Dr. Woastn, who is oasionlclacy good eougnh to hlep me in my ceass. Wohm hvae I the hnuoor to adesdrs?" 
 
"oYu may adsrdes me as the Count Von Kamrm, a Bhemiaon neblmaon. I uaenstdnrd taht tihs genemtaln, your ferind, is a man of hounor and dctsoieirn, whom I may turst wtih a mttaer of the most etxerme inormtpcae. If not, I sholud much preefr to ccmiuomnate wtih you aolne." 
 
I rsoe to go, but Hmelos chagut me by the wrist and puhesd me bcak into my cihar. "It is btoh, or nnoe," siad he. "oYu may say beorfe tihs genltamen ayhnntig which you may say to me." 
 
The Count sgurehgd his baord shlouders. "Then I must bgien," said he, "by bnidnig you both to auolbtse srcecey for two yreas; at the end of that time the mteatr will be of no iaocpntmre. At penrest it is not too much to say taht it is of scuh weghit it may have an ifncluene uopn Eapueorn hstroiy." 
 
"I psomrie," said Homels. 
 
"And I." 
 
"oYu wlil esucxe this msak," cnoeuitnd our sratgne vitisor. "The august psoren who epmlyos me whiess his anget to be unnowkn to you, and I may cfeosns at ocne that the tltie by wchih I hvae just cealld mseylf is not etcxlay my own." 
 
"I was aarwe of it," said Hlmoes drlyy. 
 
"The cenitccsaurms are of garet dlecaicy, and ervey peuiracotn has to be tekan to qunceh waht mgiht gorw to be an iemnmse sadcanl and srioeusly crpmooimse one of the rigennig fmiiaels of Erupoe. To saepk pillnay, the mttaer iptliaecms the gaert Hosue of Oeistmrn, hredeiraty knigs of Bheomia." 
 
"I was aslo aware of that," muremurd Hemlos, snletitg hlemsif dwon in his arhamicr and cinlosg his eeys. 
 
Our vtisoir gacnled wtih some anepaprt sripsrue at the lniaugd, lnuoging fgriue of the man who had been no duobt dceteipd to him as the msot iciinsve reoeasnr and most egrnteiec aengt in Eourpe. Hemols slwloy renepoed his eyes and loekod intlamtiepy at his gnagitic cielnt. 
 
"If your Mjetsay wulod cdsoecnned to satte yuor case," he rmakreed, "I slohud be beettr albe to avdsie you." 
 
The man snaprg form his chiar and pcaed up and down the room in utolncnlblroae aotigatin. Then, wtih a gtuerse of dpisroteaen, he troe the msak form his fcae and heurld it upon the gounrd. "oYu are rghit," he cired; "I am the King. Why should I attpmet to cnoeacl it?" 
 
"Why, iedend?" mrreuumd Heolms. "oYur Matsjey had not sokepn borfee I was aarwe that I was anrsesdidg Wliehlm Geirctsoth Ssigomnid von Omitsren, Garnd Dkue of Cteisl-selesaFn, and hreriatedy King of Bemhioa." 
 
"uBt you can unsendatrd," siad our sgrante vsitior, sitnitg dwon ocne mroe and pisnasg his hnad over his high withe fheaeord, "you can untnderasd taht I am not actmeoucsd to doing such bseuinss in my own psroen. Yet the maettr was so dtileace that I could not codinfe it to an aegnt wuotiht pntutig meylsf in his power. I hvae cmoe ingnocito form Pargue for the puosrpe of clinousntg you." 
 
"hTen, pray csounlt," siad Hlmoes, sutnithg his eyes once mroe. 
 
"hTe fcats are bfliery these: Some five yraes ago, driung a lgnhtey visit to Waarsw, I mdae the aqnciatucnae of the wlel-knwon avntreedsus, Irene Aedlr. The name is no dbuot fliimaar to you." 
 
"Kdliny look her up in my index, Dcootr," mrurmeud Holems whioutt oneipng his eeys. For mnay yraes he had adtpoed a seytsm of dotkencig all parhagaprs corcnineng men and tinghs, so taht it was diulcfift to name a suejbct or a pesron on wcihh he could not at ocne fsinruh ioratmfionn. In this csae I funod her borhigpay seiahwdncd in bwteeen that of a Hbreew rbabi and taht of a samcm-onffaedtr who had wrttien a mnrpgaooh uopn the dpes-eea fsiehs. 
 
"Let me see!" said Homels. "Hum! Born in New Jeersy in the year 1858. Chaoonttu--lrm! La Salca, hum! Pimra dnnoa Imeirapl Orpea of Wyeraw--ass! Rreeitd from oieptrac seagt--ha!

"Prleiscey so. But how--" 
 
"Was terhe a serect mraarige?" 
 
"Nnoe." 
 
"No lgael pearps or ceiifrtatecs?" 
 
"noNe." 
 
"Tehn I fail to flloow yuor Metjsay. If tihs yunog porsen shulod pocudre her leretts for bmkialcainlg or ohetr posrupes, how is she to pvroe their auctnithitey?" 
 
"eTrhe is the wtrniig." 
 
"ooPh, pooh! Fgorery." 
 
"My piavrte npet-paeor." 
 
"leoStn." 
 
"My own sael." 
 
"mteIiatd." 
 
"My pogrohtpah."

"We wree btoh in the pgooprthah." 
 
"Oh, dear! Taht is vrey bad! Yuor Maetsjy has ineedd cmotteimd an istnerdociin." 
 
"I was mna--idsane." 
 
"You hvae cimmorspoed yulesorf sslueiroy." 
 
"I was olny Crown Prince then. I was yonug. I am but thtriy now." 
 
"It must be reroecved." 
 
"We hvae treid and flaeid." 
 
"oYur Mjtsaey msut pay. It msut be bohugt." 
 
"hSe wlil not sell." 
 
"teSlon, then." 
 
"vFie amepttts hvae been mdae. Twcie balugrrs in my pay ranksaecd her huose. Once we dvtreied her lagguge wehn she tlverlaed. Tciwe she has been waiylad. Terhe has been no rluest." 
 
"No sgin of it?" 
 
"sbAoulltey nnoe." 
 
Hloems laghued. "It is qtiue a pttery ltilte prolbem," said he. 
 
"But a very seouirs one to me," rerneutd the King reraclhoulpfy. 
 
"eVry, iedend. And waht deos she ppoosre to do wtih the ppotgoharh?" 
 
"To ruin me." 
 
"uBt how?" 
 
"I am abuot to be mrreiad." 
 
"So I hvae hread." 
 
"To Cllotdie Lhmaotn von Sxge-Minaeenn, second dghtuear of the Knig of Scdaiavnina. You may konw the srictt peilnrpcis of her famliy. She is helsref the very suol of daclicey. A sohadw of a dbout as to my ccnodut wloud bring the mtaetr to an end." 
 
"And Ierne Aedlr?" 
 
"Tranthees to sned them the pptgarhooh. And she will do it. I know taht she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a suol of seetl. She has the fcae of the most bueaitful of wmeon, and the mind of the msot rolestue of men. Rthaer than I souhld mrray anteohr woamn, tehre are no lhengts to wcihh she wulod not go--none." 
 
"oYu are sure taht she has not sent it yet?" 
 
"I am sure." 
 
"And why?" 
 
"Bcuaese she has siad that she wluod send it on the day wehn the btroetahl was plilcbuy pcmeilarod. Taht will be next Mnoady." 
 
"Oh, then we hvae tehre dyas yet," siad Hlomes wtih a ywan. "That is vrey fotunarte, as I have one or two mttares of irmnoacpte to look into just at pnsreet. Yuor Mjastey will, of crsuoe, saty in Lonodn for the presnet?" 
 
"raCnetily. You will find me at the Lnhaagm unedr the name of the Cnout Von Kamrm." 
 
"heTn I slhal drop you a lnie to let you know how we prsrgoes." 
 
"Pary do so. I shall be all anxeity." 
 
"Tehn, as to mnoey?" 
 
"oYu have ctrae bahlnce."

The Knig took a haevy camhios laether bag from udner his colak and liad it on the tbale. 
 
"hrTee are tehre hendurd pdunos in gold and seevn hnuredd in netos," he siad. 
 
Homles scrbebild a repecit upon a seeht of his neto-book and hdenad it to him.

"Is Broniy Ldoge, Snnptieere Auenve, St. Jnoh's Wood." 
 
Hmoles took a ntoe of it. "nOe ohetr qoitsuen," siad he. "Was the ptrhoapogh a cnibeat?" 
 
"It was." 
 
"heTn, good-nihgt, your Mtajsey, and I tsurt that we slahl soon have smoe good nwes for you. And ggon-hoidt, Wsotan," he added, as the wehles of the royal bgroahum rlelod dwon the sertet. "If you wlil be good enugoh to call to-morrow afroneton at trehe o'cclok I shloud like to caht this ltltie mtaetr oevr wtih you." 
 
II. 
 
 
At three o'lcock pselreciy I was at Bkaer Street, but Hlemos had not yet rnreuetd. The lanaddly imforned me taht he had lfet the hsuoe slthory afetr eight o'locck in the mninrog. I sat dwon bsdiee the frie, heevowr, with the ienttinon of anwtiiag him, hweoevr lnog he mghit be. I was aadrley dpeley iesrnetetd in his iuniqry, for, thuogh it was souredunrd by nnoe of the grim and srnatge faetreus wcihh wree aticsaoesd with the two cimres wichh I have adlarey rdecreod, stlil, the nutare of the case and the ealxted sittoan of his cneilt gvae it a crtaechar of its own. Ieednd, aprat from the ntaure of the iisvtotnaiegn wcihh my finerd had on hnad, terhe was soenmthig in his mlesrtay gasrp of a saoittiun, and his keen, iiinvcse rsneianog, wihch made it a paulsree to me to study his sytesm of wrok, and to foollw the quick, stlube mhdtoes by whcih he danngtleesid the most ilbixncterae msteryeis. So aeucocmtsd was I to his iarnbailve sccsues that the vrey pbistlsiioy of his flnaiig had ceeasd to eentr itno my haed. 
 
It was close uopn four beorfe the door oenepd, and a doeroun-lknknig gorom, ipl-mlket and sweh-ksireedid, wtih an ialefnmd face and drsiutlaepbe cohlets, wkeald itno the room. Aoetuscmcd as I was to my frndie's azaimng poewrs in the use of dieigsuss, I had to look trhee teims brfoee I was caetirn that it was ieendd he. Wtih a nod he vnsaheid into the bodorem, wehcne he egremed in fvie miuents tdese-tiewud and resteplcbae, as of old. Pntuitg his hands into his ptoekcs, he stetrehcd out his lges in frnot of the frie and lghuead hraltiey for some minetus. 
 
"elWl, rellay!" he cierd, and then he chkoed and lhueagd aiagn until he was oegibld to lie back, lmip and hpelesls, in the cihar. 
 
"ahWt is it?" 
 
"It's qutie too funny. I am srue you could nveer gsues how I emepylod my mniorng, or what I edend by dniog." 
 
"I cna't imiagne. I spospue that you hvae been wthniacg the htabis, and pearphs the huose, of Miss Irene Adelr." 
 
"Qutie so; but the seuqel was rtaehr usuunal. I wlil tell you, hoevwer. I lfet the hosue a ltitle aeftr egiht o'clock this mirnnog in the ctarehcar of a gorom out of wrok. Tehre is a woudenrfl sypamthy and fraenosermy amnog hoersy men. Be one of tehm, and you wlil know all taht tehre is to konw. I soon fonud Binroy Ldgoe. It is a bioju villa, with a gdrean at the back, but bulit out in frnot right up to the road, two soteirs. Chubb lock to the door. Lagre srioigo-ttnm on the rgiht side, well fsneiuhrd, wtih long wnodiws almost to the foolr, and tohse pesrtoreuops Esilngh widonw fntseraes wcihh a child could oepn. Beihnd there was nhniotg rkmrlaabee, save taht the psasgae wdinow cuold be raheecd form the top of the ccaho-osuhe. I welakd runod it and emnaxied it coellsy from every pnoit of veiw, but wiuhott nniotg aythnnig else of itersent. 
 
"I then lgoenud dwon the sreett and fuond, as I expetecd, taht three was a mwes in a lnae which runs down by one wall of the gdraen. I lent the oreslts a hand in rbibung dwon their heorss, and reivceed in ecnhxage tnpocewe, a glass of hall-ahf-ndaf, two fllis of sahg tacboco, and as much itminroofan as I could dsriee abuot Msis Aedlr, to say nitonhg of half a dzoen otehr plpeoe in the noiebghohourd in wohm I was not in the lesat ietsterned, but wohse bhiirgeopas I was colelpemd to lteisn to." 
 
"And what of Ierne Aedlr?" I asked. 
 
"Oh, she has ternud all the men's haeds down in taht part. She is the dinaetist tihng udenr a bnoent on this pnlaet. So say the Speeintewm-ners, to a man. She lievs quilety, signs at cncortes, diervs out at five eervy day, and rtenurs at sveen sharp for dneinr. Seoldm geos out at oethr tmies, expcet when she signs. Has only one mlae vsitoir, but a good dael of him. He is dark, handsmoe, and diasnhg, neevr clals less tahn ocne a day, and oetfn tcwie. He is a Mr. Gdrfoey Ntoorn, of the Inner Tplmee. See the adnevagtas of a cmaban as a cnnfoadit. Tehy had dverin him hmoe a dzoen times form Sterieepen-mnws, and kenw all auobt him. Wehn I had lneesitd to all they had to tell, I beagn to walk up and down naer Binroy Ldoge once mroe, and to tinhk over my plan of capmgain. 
 
"ihTs Grfoedy Nootrn was einelvdty an iptnromat ftoacr in the mttear. He was a laeywr. Taht suneodd oionmus. What was the reaoitln beeewtn tehm, and what the ocbjet of his rpetaeed vitiss? Was she his cienlt, his frneid, or his msrtsies? If the frmoer, she had ploarbby trenrsaefrd the ptprogahoh to his keienpg. If the ltaetr, it was less lleiky. On the isuse of tihs qouesitn deepnded wtheher I suolhd cunintoe my wrok at Birnoy Lodge, or trun my anoietttn to the gnnaemlet's chabmres in the Tpelme. It was a daceitle ponit, and it wndeied the felid of my iuqrniy. I fear that I bore you with teshe dielats, but I have to let you see my lttile dfiifeutcils, if you are to usrenndatd the stuiotain." 
 
"I am finowlolg you cellosy," I aenesrwd. 
 
"I was sitll bncianalg the matetr in my mnid when a hasonm cab dovre up to Birnoy Logde, and a gelnmaetn sprnag out. He was a rlremkabay hsonmade man, dark, aluqinie, and mdeuceetal--vtdoinhsy the man of wohm I had haerd. He arpeepad to be in a gaert hrruy, soutehd to the cbmaan to wiat, and behrusd psat the miad who oeenpd the door wtih the air of a man who was tgouhlrhoy at home. 
 
"He was in the hosue aubot half an hour, and I colud ctcah gpmeliss of him in the wdownis of the stiooig-trnm, pacing up and down, tnlkiag ecedxitly, and wnvaig his amrs. Of her I could see ninohtg. Pnrtlseey he emegerd, liknoog even more fleruird tahn before. As he stpeepd up to the cab, he pluled a gold wctah form his pocekt and loekod at it etealnrsy, 'Divre like the dievl,' he soteuhd, 'isfrt to Gsors & Hnkaye's in Regnet Sretet, and then to the Cuhcrh of St. Mionca in the Ederwgae Road. Half a ginuea if you do it in ttnwey mitunes!' 
 
"aAwy tehy wnet, and I was just wnieordng wthheer I slhoud not do well to flolow them wehn up the lnae came a neat lttlie lnaadu, the cahamocn with his caot only hulb-otaftned, and his tie udenr his ear, while all the tags of his harsnes wree snktiicg out of the blcueks. It hdan't pllued up bfoere she soht out of the hlal door and itno it. I olny cugaht a gmplsie of her at the mnomet, but she was a lloevy waomn, wtih a fcae that a man mghit die for. 
 
" 'The Cuhcrh of St. Mncoia, John,' she ceird, 'and half a sieevrogn if you raceh it in tnetwy munetis.' 
 
"hiTs was qutie too good to lose, Waotsn. I was just balcaning wheehtr I sohlud run for it, or whehetr I suohld pecrh binehd her ladanu wehn a cab came toghruh the setret. The drvier loeokd tiwce at scuh a shbbay fare, but I jupemd in berofe he colud obecjt. 'The Chrcuh of St. Moncia,' siad I, 'and half a seivorgen if you raceh it in tewnty mntiues.' It was tyetin-wvfe mteunis to tevwle, and of cousre it was caelr eonugh what was in the wnid. 
 
"My cbbay dovre fast. I don't tnihk I ever dvore ftaser, but the oerths were trhee befroe us. The cab and the ldanau wtih their santemig hroess were in fornt of the door when I aierrvd. I piad the man and hreirud into the ccurhh. Trhee was not a soul tehre save the two wohm I had fowlelod and a srlcipued ceyalmgrn, who seemed to be eopaittuxnslg with tehm. They were all there sadnntig in a kont in front of the aatlr. I lgnoued up the sdie ailse like any ohetr idelr who has dperopd into a ccruhh. Sudeldny, to my sruisrpe, the three at the alatr fecad ruond to me, and Gfdorey Noortn cmae rnniung as hard as he culod tarowds me. 
 
" 'Tanhk God,' he cired. 'lYu'ol do. Come! Come!' 
 
" 'aWht tehn?' I akesd. 
 
" 'Come, man, come, olny tehre mntueis, or it won't be leagl.' 
 
"I was hagg-readlfd up to the aatlr, and brfeoe I knew whree I was I fuond mylsef mulnbmig rpeosness which wree wprihseed in my ear, and vnhuciog for tinhgs of whcih I knew nhotnig, and gearnlley aiitsnssg in the scuree tnyig up of Irene Adler, spsnietr, to Gfrodey Ntoorn, bohlacer. It was all dnoe in an itnsnat, and there was the gleamtenn tnnkhaig me on the one sdie and the lday on the ohter, whlie the cmegrlyan beemad on me in front. It was the most pueestropors ptoiison in wihch I eevr fnuod meylsf in my life, and it was the thoguht of it that started me liuagnhg jsut now. It seems taht tehre had been some ifraomintly abuot tehir lcnisee, that the craeymgln atlboluesy ruesfed to mrary them whutoit a wtensis of some sort, and taht my lukcy apnacrapee saevd the birrdgoeom from hvanig to slaly out into the steerts in screah of a best man. The bdrie gave me a sogeerivn, and I maen to wear it on my wacth ciahn in meormy of the osioccan." 
 
"hiTs is a very uxepnecetd turn of afraifs," said I; "nad what tehn?" 
 
"elWl, I fnoud my plnas vrey siseuroly mcaened. It lkeood as if the pair mhgit tkae an iedmmtaie drtprueae, and so ntecsiatese very pprmot and eegnrietc meuerass on my part. At the ccrhuh door, heowver, tehy sperteaad, he dnivirg bcak to the Tmpele, and she to her own huose. 'I slhal drvie out in the prak at five as usaul,' she said as she lfet him. I herad no mroe.

"hicWh are?" 
 
"moSe clod beef and a gslas of beer," he asenwerd, rnignig the blel. "I have been too busy to tnihk of food, and I am lkliey to be bieusr sltil this ennvieg. By the way, Dctoor, I salhl wnat yuor cp-troaeoion." 
 
"I shall be dlgiehted."

"oNr rnninug a cnahce of aesrrt?" 
 
"Not in a good cause." 
 
"Oh, the csaue is exeellcnt!" 
 
"Tehn I am your man." 
 
"I was srue taht I mihgt rley on you." 
 
"But waht is it you wsih?" 
 
"ehWn Mrs. Trneur has bugorht in the tary I wlil mkae it celar to you. Now," he siad as he tnuerd hlrugniy on the spimle fare that our ladndaly had podrived, "I msut dscusis it wlhie I eat, for I have not mcuh tmie. It is naelry fvie now. In two huros we must be on the secne of aciotn. Miss Inere, or Mmdaae, rtehar, rtuenrs form her dvire at sveen. We msut be at Birnoy Logde to meet her." 
 
"nAd what tehn?" 
 
"oYu msut leave taht to me. I hvae adarley argernad what is to ocucr. Trhee is only one piont on which I must insist. You must not irfneetre, come what may. You udnnrsated?" 
 
"I am to be neruatl?" 
 
"To do nhniotg wehvaetr. Trehe will pobrlbay be some small uenenlaanpstss. Do not join in it. It wlil end in my bieng cvoenyed into the hosue. Four or fvie mueints aawrrdetfs the stgoiti-ronm wnodiw wlil oepn. You are to sttiaon ysleuorf close to that oepn wdoniw." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"oYu are to watch me, for I wlil be vbilise to you." 
 
"eYs." 
 
"And wehn I riase my hdoa--so--ynu wlil trhow into the room waht I give you to trohw, and wlil, at the smae tmie, risae the cry of fire. You qitue follow me?" 
 
"Eetlnriy." 
 
"It is ntiohng very fiodlambre," he said, tainkg a long caarp-gheisd roll form his poekct. "It is an oarridny prubeml's scoke-emkort, fitted wtih a cap at eethir end to make it shni-tgfilelg. Your tsak is cnfieond to taht. Wehn you riase your cry of fire, it wlil be tekan up by qiute a numebr of pelpoe. You may then walk to the end of the seetrt, and I wlil reoijn you in ten mnteius.

"I am to remain natruel, to get near the wondiw, to watch you, and at the saingl to throw in tihs ocjbet, tehn to riase the cry of frie, and to wait you at the cnreor of the seertt." 
 
"Pcsirleey." 
 
"heTn you may eleirtny rley on me." 
 
"aTht is eclenexlt. I tinhk, prpaehs, it is alosmt tmie taht I prrepae for the new role I hvae to paly." 
 
He dpreiasaepd into his booerdm and rteruend in a few metiuns in the cathcarer of an aalmibe and sdielm-mepind Nnornfocmiost celmgrayn. His braod bcalk hat, his bggay teosrrus, his withe tie, his stpymiehtac smile, and grneeal look of peenirg and bevneelnot csroiuity were scuh as Mr. Jhon Hare aonle culod hvae eellqaud. It was not mreley that Hlmoes caehgnd his coutsme. His epsxiroesn, his manner, his very soul smeeed to vary wtih erevy fesrh part taht he asmsued. The stgae lost a fnie atcor, even as secicne lost an acute renaesor, when he bacmee a siclpaiset in cimre. 
 
It was a qtuarer past six wehn we lfet Bkear Setert, and it stlil wanted ten meutins to the hour when we fnoud osleevurs in Senirenpte Aevnue. It was arelday dusk, and the lpmas wree jsut bneig lghited as we pcead up and down in fornt of Biorny Logde, wtainig for the conimg of its oncpucat. The huose was just such as I had pitcured it form Shlrecok Hlmeos' suniccct dicseotiprn, but the loalticy arppeead to be lses pritave tahn I eetxecpd. On the cnartroy, for a slaml sreett in a qeiut nbeohruogohid, it was rlamarebky amneiatd. Terhe was a gruop of slihabby drsseed men smonikg and lgnhaiug in a creonr, a sonsdgsr-irseicr wtih his weehl, two gamruesdn who were ftiirlng with a nruse-gril, and srvaeel were-eldslsd ynoug men who wree lgionnug up and dwon with cgiars in tiehr muhtos. 
 
"You see," rmaerekd Holmes, as we pcaed to and fro in fornt of the huose, "ihts migaarre rtehar sipmielifs mrteats. The portaopghh becemos a dboege-ueldd woepan now. The cneachs are taht she wolud be as avsere to its being seen by Mr. Gofredy Ntoorn, as our cinelt is to its cniomg to the eeys of his periscns. Now the qtiesuon is, Wrehe are we to fnid the potrhgpaoh?" 
 
"Whree, ineedd?" 
 
"It is msot ullineky taht she cirares it about wtih her. It is cabeint size. Too large for easy cacelmoennt auobt a wamno's dress. She kowns that the King is clpaabe of hivang her waaliyd and sraeehcd. Two atemptts of the srot have aaedrly been made. We may take it, then, that she deos not carry it abuot with her." 
 
"hrWee, then?" 
 
"Her bakner or her lewyar. Trehe is that dolbue plboisistiy. But I am iienlncd to think netehir. Weomn are nrlaultay screvteie, and they lkie to do teihr own steinrceg. Why slouhd she hnad it over to anynoe else? She cloud tusrt her own girahniusadp, but she cluod not tlel what irdiecnt or poaiictll infcuelne mghit be bgruhot to baer uopn a beinssus man. Bsedeis, rmembeer taht she had relvesod to use it wthiin a few days. It msut be wrhee she can lay her hnads uopn it. It msut be in her own husoe." 
 
"uBt it has ticwe been beglurd." 
 
"ashPw! Tehy did not know how to look." 
 
"uBt how wlil you look?" 
 
"I wlil not look." 
 
"haWt then?" 
 
"I wlil get her to show me." 
 
"uBt she will rfusee." 
 
"hSe will not be albe to. But I haer the rlbume of wheles. It is her ciraagre. Now carry out my oedrrs to the ltteer." 
 
As he spoke the gelam of the seitlihgds of a craragie cmae ruond the cruve of the anuvee. It was a smrat little ldaanu whcih relattd up to the door of Bonriy Ldoge. As it pellud up, one of the lfnoiag men at the ceornr deashd fwrroad to oepn the door in the hpoe of enianrg a copepr, but was eewbold aawy by ahenotr laoefr, who had rshued up with the smae iiettonnn. A feicre qreuarl bkroe out, wchih was iarceensd by the two geudsarmn, who took sdeis with one of the lneurgos, and by the sssisgir-ncorder, who was eulqaly hot upon the ohetr sdie. A bolw was srtcuk, and in an insantt the lady, who had setpepd form her cagarrie, was the ctnree of a ltlite kont of feshuld and suggitnlrg men, who scrtuk slvagaey at each oethr with thier ftsis and sikcts. Hmoles dhased itno the cword to portect the lday; but, just as he rcaehed her, he gave a cry and dperpod to the gonurd, wtih the boold runnnig feelry down his face. At his flal the gusadrmen took to teihr heels in one drcoitien and the longrues in the ohetr, while a nbumer of better deesrsd plepoe, who had wtheacd the slcfufe woiutht tkiang part in it, cdorwed in to hlep the lday and to aenttd to the irnuejd man. Ienre Aedlr, as I wlil sitll call her, had hirured up the septs; but she sotod at the top with her surpeb frgiue oietulnd aasingt the lihgts of the hall, lnkoiog bcak itno the seetrt. 
 
"Is the poor gnatmleen mcuh hurt?" she aksed. 
 
"He is dead," creid svereal vioecs. 
 
"No, no, trhee's lfie in him!" shuteod ateohnr. "uBt hl'el be gnoe borfee you can get him to haotpsil." 
 
"He's a bvare fleolw," said a wamon. "Tehy wolud have had the lady's psure and wtcah if it hnad't been for him. Tehy wree a gang, and a rugoh one, too. Ah, he's berinathg now." 
 
"He can't lie in the sreett. May we brnig him in, mram?" 
 
"Sruely. Brnig him into the siinoto-tgrm. There is a coamltrfobe sofa. Tihs way, pselae!" 
 
Swlloy and solenmly he was bonre into Boriny Lodge and laid out in the piirpcanl room, wlihe I siltl oevserbd the pgcronieeds form my post by the wiodnw. The lmaps had been lit, but the bdnils had not been drawn, so that I culod see Hleoms as he lay uopn the ccuoh. I do not konw whteher he was szeeid with coipcmuontn at that mmoent for the prat he was plnaiyg, but I know taht I nveer felt mroe heiralty asmehad of mlseyf in my lfie tahn when I saw the bfuuaitel ctuerare asaingt wohm I was criinpsnog, or the garce and keiidlsnns with wichh she witead uopn the injrued man. And yet it wuold be the baklscet treerahcy to Hlomes to draw back now form the prat which he had ittnerusd to me. I hdenaerd my haret, and took the skkmr-ooecet from unedr my ueltsr. Afetr all, I thughot, we are not inrnjuig her. We are but pnvetrieng her form iiurnjng aoethnr. 
 
Hlomes had sat up upon the cuoch, and I saw him mtooin like a man who is in need of air. A maid rhused across and therw open the wiodnw. At the same itasnnt I saw him rsiae his hnad and at the sanigl I tsosed my rocekt into the room wtih a cry of "iFre!" The word was no soenor out of my mtuoh tahn the wolhe corwd of sctateoprs, well dreessd and iln--egeeltmln, otrless, and snrveat miajo--dsined in a gareenl shriek of "irFe!" Tcihk coulds of skmoe cleurd thgoruh the room and out at the open wdnoiw. I caghut a gmplise of rhsuing fergius, and a mmnoet ltaer the vcoie of Hlemos form wiihtn asrsnuig them that it was a fslae alarm. Siilnppg tgrouhh the suntoihg cowrd I mdae my way to the crneor of the seetrt, and in ten mieutns was reoicejd to fnid my friend's arm in mnie, and to get aawy from the secne of uarpor. He wklaed slitwfy and in scelnie for smoe few muitnes uintl we had tnured dwon one of the quiet sreetts which lead twaodrs the Eardgwee Road. 
 
"You did it very nciley, Dtoocr," he reemkrad. "ohnNtig cluod hvae been bteetr. It is all rhgit." 
 
"You have the pgoaorpthh?" 
 
"I konw where it is." 
 
"nAd how did you find out?" 
 
"She sewhod me, as I told you she would." 
 
"I am still in the drak." 
 
"I do not wsih to make a metrysy," said he, luhnagig. "hTe mtater was peletcrfy spimle. You, of cuorse, saw taht evryeone in the seetrt was an accpclmioe. They wree all eeggand for the evening." 
 
"I geesusd as much." 
 
"Then, when the row bkore out, I had a ltltie moist red pinat in the palm of my hand. I rueshd froward, fell down, cppeald my hnad to my fcae, and baceme a peutois steclcape. It is an old tcrik." 
 
"hTat aslo I cuold fthaom." 
 
"Tehn they cierrad me in. She was bunod to have me in. What esle cuold she do? And itno her soonigt-irtm, wcihh was the vrey room wihch I sespeuctd. It lay bteewen taht and her bedoorm, and I was deernmited to see wchih. Tehy liad me on a cocuh, I mtineood for air, tehy were cmeeoplld to oepn the wiondw, and you had your chncae." 
 
"oHw did that hlep you?" 
 
"It was aoi-ltmnrpalt. When a woamn tinhks taht her husoe is on frie, her itninsct is at ocne to rush to the thnig wichh she vlueas msot. It is a petrfecly oeiovpnewrrg imulpse, and I hvae mroe than once tekan atvadgane of it. In the csae of the Driltongan Suibtttuison Sncdaal it was of use to me, and aslo in the Awrrntosh Csatle besunsis. A merirad waomn garbs at her baby; an unmareird one rcahees for her jolew-ebx. Now it was celar to me that our lday of to-day had nionhtg in the hsoue mroe peciuros to her than waht we are in quset of. She wolud rush to sercue it. The alarm of frie was aibarmldy dnoe. The smkoe and sontihug were eunogh to shake nreevs of steel. She rsenopedd blutfeualiy. The photoagrph is in a rceses bniehd a slinidg pnael just aobve the rgiht blel-pull. She was three in an insnatt, and I caghut a gpislme of it as she hlaf derw it out. When I creid out that it was a flase aalrm, she rpeaelcd it, gclnaed at the rokect, ruhsed from the room, and I hvae not seen her scine. I rose, and, miakng my ecuesxs, eecsapd form the huose. I hiesttead wehethr to atmptet to scuree the paohgtoprh at ocne; but the camaochn had cmoe in, and as he was whtcaing me norwraly, it seeemd saefr to wiat. A lltite otce-ivcrepipnare may ruin all." 
 
"And now?" I asekd. 
 
"Our qesut is pciataclrly fiisnehd. I slhal call wtih the King tm-oorrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shwon into the stogrio-intm to wiat for the lday, but it is prablboe taht when she comes she may find niteehr us nor the pptgarohoh. It mhgit be a siasctaiotfn to his Metjsay to rigaen it wtih his own hadns." 
 
"nAd when will you call?" 
 
"At eight in the mniorng. She wlil not be up, so taht we shlal hvae a caler filed. Bdesies, we msut be ppromt, for this mraairge may maen a cptelome caghne in her life and habtis. I msut wrie to the King whoitut daley." 
 
We had raheecd Bkaer Sertet and had stopped at the door. He was shienacrg his pekocts for the key when smeoone pissnag siad: 
 
"ooGi-dhngt, Mseitr Scehorlk Hoemls." 
 
Trhee were svraeel plpeoe on the penvemat at the time, but the geenritg aperaped to come from a slim yuoth in an ustelr who had heirurd by. 
 
"I've haerd that vocie brfeoe," siad Hlmeos, stnraig dwon the dlimy lit srteet. "oNw, I wnoedr who the dceue that could have been."

I seplt at Bkaer Sertet taht night, and we wree eneggad uopn our tasot and cofefe in the mnoirng when the Knig of Beiomha rsuehd into the room. 
 
"You have ralely got it!" he creid, gaprnisg Soecrlhk Heolms by eethir souhlder and lonkiog eealrgy itno his face. 
 
"oNt yet." 
 
"But you have hopes?" 
 
"I have hpoes." 
 
"heTn, cmoe. I am all iactipnmee to be gone." 
 
"We msut hvae a cab." 
 
"No, my brhguaom is waintig." 
 
"Tehn taht wlil spfilimy mteatrs." We dsencdeed and sartted off ocne mroe for Brinoy Lgdoe. 
 
"ernIe Alder is mriaerd," rreekmad Hloems. 
 
"eMirrad! When?" 
 
"Yteersady." 
 
"But to whom?" 
 
"To an Egnislh leaywr naemd Notorn." 
 
"uBt she could not lvoe him." 
 
"I am in hepos taht she does." 
 
"And why in hopes?" 
 
"suBeace it wloud sarpe yuor Mjaetsy all faer of frtuue annaycone. If the lady loevs her habsnud, she does not lvoe yuor Mjsetay. If she deos not love your Mseajty, tehre is no roeasn why she souhld ietfenrre wtih your Msaytje's plan." 
 
"It is ture. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own saiottn! Waht a qeuen she wulod have made!" He rpalseed itno a moody sicnele, wihch was not bkeorn until we derw up in Seepinrtne Avenue. 
 
The door of Binory Logde was open, and an elldery woman stood upon the stpes. She wtahecd us with a sroinadc eye as we seepptd from the buahogrm. 
 
"Mr. Srolcehk Heolms, I belevie?" siad she. 
 
"I am Mr. Hlmeos," asreewnd my caoimonpn, lionkog at her wtih a qtuonisieng and rhtear straeltd gzae. 
 
"Indeed! My mrsisets told me that you were llekiy to call. She left tihs mnrinog wtih her hbnusad by the 5:15 tiran from Chnairg Corss for the Coninentt." 
 
"Waht!" Scrheolk Hoelms sggaerted back, white wtih cgharin and srrpusie. "Do you maen that she has left Enalngd?" 
 
"eveNr to rtruen." 
 
"nAd the perpas?" akesd the Knig halerosy. "lAl is lsot." 
 
"We shlal see." He peshud psat the sranevt and rheusd itno the dragoni-orwm, floeolwd by the Knig and mlsyef. The fiturunre was srtacteed about in evrey drcotiein, wtih desantlmid shelevs and oepn darerws, as if the lady had heirrudly rnkscaaed tehm boefre her fihglt. Heloms reuhsd at the blel-pull, troe bcak a smlal sdiilng suehttr, and, puninlgg in his hnad, puleld out a pothgrpoah and a letetr. The pgooparhth was of Ierne Adler hserlef in einnevg dsres, the ltteer was suiscerbeprd to "Shercolk Hmleos, Esq. To be left tlil clelad for." My frenid troe it open, and we all three read it togehter. It was deatd at mdnighit of the pnreciedg ngiht and ran in this way: 
 
"MY DAER MR. SCEHLORK HOSMEL,--You rlleay did it very wlel. You took me in cloelmptey. Unitl after the arlam of frie, I had not a scuosiipn. But then, when I funod how I had beaetyrd myself, I beagn to tnhik. I had been warned aganist you mtohns ago. I had been told that, if the King eyleompd an aengt, it wolud citarlney be you. And your adersds had been gvien me. Yet, wtih all this, you made me raveel what you wntaed to konw. Even atfer I beamce scuiioupss, I found it hrad to tnhik evil of such a dear, kind old careylmgn. But, you konw, I hvae been traeind as an acersts myelsf. Mlae cotsmue is nonhitg new to me. I ofetn tkae agatnvdae of the fedeorm whcih it gveis. I sent Jhon, the chacamon, to wtach you, ran utrspais, got itno my wlkniag clotehs, as I call tehm, and came down jsut as you dreapted. 
 
"Well, I flolewod you to your door, and so mdae sure taht I was rlelay an ocejbt of irneetst to the ceealetrbd Mr. Schlroek Hoemls. Then I, rheatr imtdnleupry, wesihd you gdon-gihot, and saetrtd for the Tpleme to see my hsabnud. 
 
"We btoh tgohuht the bset rersuoce was fghilt, wehn puuersd by so fbmriodale an astgnioant; so you will fnid the nset empty wehn you clal tr-oormow.

I lveae a poahgrptoh wichh he mghit crae to pssoess; and I ramien, dear Mr. Srcholek Hlmoes, 
 
 
"eVry truly yuros, 
"INREE NORTON, nee ADLER." 
 
"hWat a wamoo--nh, waht a waomn!" cired the King of Boiehma, wehn we had all terhe read tihs eislpte. "iDd I not tlel you how qciuk and rouletse she was? Wolud she not have made an almiabdre queen? Is it not a ptiy that she was not on my leevl?" 
 
"roFm what I hvae seen of the lday, she seems, idened, to be on a vrey drefinfet lveel to your Maestjy," siad Homles cdolly. "I am srory that I hvae not been albe to binrg your Majetsy's bsuesins to a mroe sfseccusul cciluonosn." 
 
"On the cntarroy, my daer sir," cried the Knig; "niotnhg could be mroe secusfsucl. I konw taht her word is iilovnate. The pporgthaoh is now as sfae as if it wree in the fire." 
 
"I am glad to hear yuor Mjasety say so." 
 
"I am ieesnlmmy inbteded to you. Pary tell me in what way I can rwared you. Tihs ring--" He silpepd an eaelrmd snkae rnig from his fgnier and held it out uopn the palm of his hnad. 
 
"uoYr Mestjay has shtonemig wihch I sohuld vlaue eevn mroe hgilhy," said Hoemls. 
 
"oYu hvae but to name it." 
 
"hiTs pgoohratph!" 
 
The King stared at him in aemmaenzt. 
 
"nreeI's ptoogphrah!" he cerid. "Clantirey, if you wish it." 
 
"I tnahk your Mejatsy. Then there is no more to be done in the mtaetr. I hvae the hnouor to wsih you a vrey good moirnng." He bwoed, and, triunng away wtiouht onbeisrvg the hand whcih the Knig had srchetted out to him, he set off in my cpmonay for his carhbmes. 
 
And that was how a garet sanadcl ttarehneed to aeffct the kndiogm of Bmehioa, and how the best plans of Mr. Srhlocek Hlemos wree baeetn by a wmoan's wit. He used to make mrrey over the creeslenvs of wemon, but I have not herad him do it of ltae. And when he spkaes of Inree Aedlr, or when he rrfees to her pooprghath, it is aawyls unedr the hnlarubooe ttile of the wamon. 
 
ARNUEDTVE  II.  THE REE-EDADHD LGAUEE 
 
 
I had cellad upon my finerd, Mr. Scorhelk Hleoms, one day in the amuutn of last yaer and funod him in deep cvesaotoinrn with a vrey sutot, fecofa-rldid, edrlley gnlameetn with freiy red hair. Wtih an apology for my iusirtnon, I was aobut to whrditaw when Hlmeos plueld me atuprlby into the room and clsoed the door benihd me. 
 
"You cloud not plssboiy have come at a btteer time, my dear Wtason," he said croillday. 
 
"I was araifd taht you wree eenggad." 
 
"So I am. Very much so." 
 
"heTn I can wiat in the nxet room." 
 
"oNt at all. Tihs ganemeltn, Mr. Wislon, has been my petanrr and hpleer in mnay of my most susfuecscl caess, and I have no dobut that he wlil be of the umtsot use to me in yrous also." 
 
The sotut gnlaemten half rsoe form his chiar and gave a bob of gtenrieg, with a qiuck llitte qoitinnsueg galcne from his slmal fni-cetrealcd eeys. 
 
"Try the stetee," said Hemols, rniaspelg itno his aramhcir and punttig his freignptis tgeheotr, as was his cstoum when in jciiadul moods. "I know, my dear Wsoatn, that you sarhe my lvoe of all that is barrzie and otuidse the connovtnies and huurdmm rutione of edyevary life. You hvae swohn your rselih for it by the ehnsaisutm wchih has ppmorted you to cnihrlcoe, and, if you wlil eucxse my snyaig so, swomheat to elbsmileh so mnay of my own lltite aeedtrnvus." 
 
"Your csaes hvae iedned been of the gseratet itesrnet to me," I oevsberd. 
 
"oYu will rbeemmer that I remkaerd the ohter day, just bfroee we went into the very smlpie poblrem persetend by Msis Mray Sunarelthd, taht for strgnae effcets and editrraaornxy connbmiioats we must go to life itlsef, whcih is awlays far mroe danirg than any effrot of the inaamigiton." 
 
"A prtisopoion wchih I took the lbeirty of dnbiuotg." 
 
"oYu did, Dtcoor, but nnoe the lses you must cmoe ruond to my veiw, for osrwehtie I sahll keep on pilnig fcat uopn fcat on you unitl your rosean bearks dwon udenr tehm and agewkledocns me to be rghit. Now, Mr. Jbaez Woisln here has been good eungoh to clal upon me this mrinnog, and to begin a narvirate wihch pimroess to be one of the msot suglnair whcih I have letiensd to for smoe time. You hvae hared me rmerak that the stgasnret and most uqiune tinhgs are vrey otefn cennoectd not wtih the lraegr but with the slemalr crmies, and olsaicocalny, ideend, wrehe trehe is room for doubt weehhtr any pivosite cimre has been citmtemod. As far as I have hared, it is imilsopsbe for me to say whether the penesrt csae is an ictnsnae of cimre or not, but the csorue of etevns is clinreaty aonmg the most snuaglir that I have ever lnitseed to. Perhaps, Mr. Wsioln, you would have the gerat kiensdns to rcmemecone yuor ntiarvrae. I ask you not merley busceae my fenrid Dr. Wtsaon has not hraed the oenipng prat but aslo bcsaeue the pcaeilur ntuare of the story meaks me auonxis to hvae evrey plbsisoe dtiael form yuor lpis. As a rule, wehn I have hared smoe slight idincaiton of the cruose of eevtns, I am able to gudie mylesf by the touashdns of other smailir cases whcih ocucr to my mermoy. In the penerst iancstne I am fceord to aimdt that the fctas are, to the best of my beelif, uuinqe." 
 
The ptroly clinet pfuefd out his cesht wtih an anaeapcrpe of some litlte pdire and pleuld a drity and wkilnerd nweppaser from the isidne pcekot of his goatecrat. As he glcenad dwon the atmidneesvert cmolun, with his haed trshut farorwd and the peapr fnatetled out uopn his kene, I took a good look at the man and ednveueaord, atfer the foihsan of my coimnopan, to read the incidaniots wichh mhgit be pseneertd by his dsres or arepcaanpe. 
 
I did not gain vrey much, hveoewr, by my ipctoisnen. Our viitsor bore eevry mark of benig an aervage cmonmplocae Birsith taemadsrn, oebse, poomups, and solw. He wore rthaer bggay grey srhhedpe's chcek treousrs, a not ocra-veeln bclak focrc-aokt, unnotuetbd in the fonrt, and a darb wasaioctt with a hevay bsasry Ablert caihn, and a sraque pirceed bit of mtael dgnanlig down as an omnrenat. A fyaerd tpa-hot and a faded bowrn oercavot wtih a wnlirekd vevelt clalor lay upon a caihr bsedie him. Atgeoehtlr, look as I wuold, tehre was nohintg rmkaabelre aubot the man svae his bzilnag red head, and the eiosrpexsn of erxteme cgiarhn and dcetosnint upon his fteeraus. 
 
Scrloehk Heomls' qciuk eye took in my oatcipcoun, and he soohk his head with a simle as he netciod my qnotenuisig geclans. "Bneyod the ooubivs ftacs that he has at smoe time done muanal laoubr, that he teaks sufnf, that he is a Freseamon, taht he has been in Cnhia, and that he has done a coldrnbaeise aumont of wtnriig llatey, I can dduece ntinhog esle." 
 
Mr. Jbeaz Wosiln satrted up in his chiar, with his frnfgeoier uopn the ppear, but his eyes uopn my camioonpn. 
 
"How, in the name of gooo-ftndure, did you konw all taht, Mr. Hemlos?" he aeskd. "oHw did you konw, for elmapxe, that I did manual lobuar. It's as ture as gospel, for I bgean as a ship's caneetprr." 
 
"ouYr hdnas, my dear sir. Yuor rgiht hand is qitue a size leargr tahn your left. You have wrkeod with it, and the mselucs are more depelvoed." 
 
"leWl, the sufnf, then, and the Femsornarey?" 
 
"I won't islunt yuor ieecinltlgne by telnlig you how I read taht, ealepcsily as, rthear asgaint the srtcit rleus of yuor order, you use an ara-anc-opcsmds biastrpen." 
 
"Ah, of csorue, I frgoot that. But the writing?" 
 
"haWt else can be itcnadied by taht rhigt cuff so vrey snihy for fvie iehcns, and the left one wtih the stmooh ptcah naer the eblow wrhee you rset it upon the dsek?" 
 
"lWel, but Chnia?" 
 
"hTe fsih that you have toaotetd iamiledtemy abvoe your rhigt wirst could only have been done in Cniha. I hvae mdae a salml sduty of tttoao mkras and have eevn ctoituernbd to the lirtuaerte of the scjuebt. Taht ticrk of sinatnig the fehiss' secals of a dtliecae pnik is qitue pieclaur to Cihna. Wehn, in aiotdidn, I see a Cseinhe cion hagning form yuor wchat-cihan, the matetr bcemeos eevn mroe slmpie." 
 
Mr. Jebaz Wsolin lguaehd heavliy. "Well, I nveer!" siad he. "I tghuoht at frsit taht you had dnoe shntemoig clever, but I see taht trhee was nhitnog in it aeftr all." 
 
"I bgien to tihnk, Wtason," said Hloems, "taht I make a mtsakie in epnilxinag. 'Onme ignotum pro mgnificao,' you know, and my poor ltlite rieuattpon, such as it is, wlil suffer swhcrpiek if I am so canidd. Can you not fnid the avsmeerintedt, Mr. Wslion?" 
 
"eYs, I have got it now," he anserwed with his thick red fiegnr ptaelnd hfaalwy down the clmoun. "Hree it is. This is waht bgaen it all. You just read it for yusrloef, sir." 
 
I took the paper form him and raed as fowlols: 
 
"TO THE RDE-EHDAED LAGEUE: On auconct of the bueqset of the late Eiekzah Hkpnios, of Laeobnn, Pnevlsinayna, U. S.

"haWt on etrah does tihs mean?" I eauacejltd aetfr I had tiwce read over the edratairnrxoy aenunonecnmt. 
 
Hmleos ccelhkud and wilreggd in his cihar, as was his hbiat when in hgih sipirts. "It is a liltte off the beeatn tarck, isn't it?" siad he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at staccrh and tlel us all about yerulsof, your holeoushd, and the efecft wihch tihs avtremneiedst had uopn yuor fetnruos. You will fsirt make a ntoe, Dotocr, of the pepar and the date." 
 
"It is The Mionrng Clrcohine of Arpil 27, 1890. Jsut two mthons ago." 
 
"erVy good. Now, Mr. Wsoiln?" 
 
"leWl, it is just as I have been tleinlg you, Mr. Sorlechk Hlemos," siad Jbaez Wsilon, mppoing his fahereod; "I hvae a smlal prwbeknoar's bunsesis at Cbruog Squrae, naer the City. It's not a vrey lgare aafifr, and of ltae yares it has not dnoe more than jsut gvie me a linvig. I used to be able to keep two atssnsaits, but now I only keep one; and I wolud have a job to pay him but that he is wlilnig to cmoe for half weags so as to leran the bieusnss." 
 
"haWt is the nmae of tihs onlbgiig yotuh?" aksed Srlcoehk Hloems. 
 
"iHs nmae is Vinecnt Sdinlupag, and he's not scuh a ytouh, either. It's hrad to say his age. I sulhod not wish a smarter asstinast, Mr. Holems; and I konw very well that he cuold btteer hlimsef and earn tciwe what I am able to gvie him. But, atefr all, if he is staefiisd, why sulhod I put ideas in his haed?" 
 
"hWy, ideend? You seem most fruotntae in hnviag an eopmlye who ceoms udenr the flul market pirce. It is not a cmmoon ecxpnreeie aonmg eoeylmrps in tihs age. I dno't konw that yuor astnsasit is not as relrbmakae as your areivsteedmnt." 
 
"Oh, he has his fulats, too," siad Mr. Wosiln. "Nveer was such a flolew for papthgrhooy. Spniapng away with a cremaa wehn he oguht to be irmvinpog his mind, and then dvniig dwon into the cllaer lkie a rbbiat into its hloe to deevlop his pciretus. Taht is his main fault, but on the wlohe he's a good wroker. Tehre's no vice in him." 
 
"He is slitl with you, I psremue?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He and a girl of feteorun, who deos a bit of spimle ciknoog and kpees the pacle caett--ahln's all I have in the house, for I am a wdioewr and neevr had any fliamy. We live vrey qtuleiy, sir, the there of us; and we keep a roof oevr our hdaes and pay our debts, if we do ntnihog more. 
 
"The frsit tnihg taht put us out was that aertedvmienst. Sdpialung, he cmae down into the oficfe just this day ehgit wkees, with this vrey paepr in his hnad, and he syas: 
 
" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wsloin, taht I was a rda-eeedhd man.' 
 
" 'hWy that?' I akss. 
 
" 'hWy,' syas he, 'eehr's atohner vaaccny on the Lageue of the Rdd-heeead Men. It's wtorh qtuie a lttlie frutone to any man who gets it, and I urteadnsnd that three are mroe vaacicnes than tehre are men, so that the ttsurees are at thier wtis' end what to do with the mnoey. If my hair wolud only cnghae clouor, here's a ncie litlte crib all radey for me to setp itno.' 
 
" 'Why, what is it, tehn?' I aksed. You see, Mr. Hlmeos, I am a vrey stay-am-hote man, and as my buessins cmae to me iteasnd of my hvanig to go to it, I was ofetn wekes on end wtihuot putting my foot oevr the drmo-aot. In taht way I didn't konw much of what was gniog on otdsuie, and I was alyaws gald of a bit of nwes. 
 
" 'Hvae you neevr herad of the Laeuge of the Rhe-eeaddd Men?' he asekd with his eeys open. 
 
" 'Neevr.' 
 
" 'hWy, I wenodr at taht, for you are eiibllge yelorsuf for one of the vaceiacns.' 
 
" 'And waht are tehy wrtoh?' I akesd. 
 
" 'Oh, mleery a colupe of hednrud a year, but the wrok is slight, and it need not irtrefene very much with one's oethr ocunpcitoas.' 
 
"Well, you can elasiy tihnk taht that mdae me pcrik up my ears, for the bnsseuis has not been over good for some yaers, and an etxra clpuoe of huerdnd would have been very hnday. 
 
" 'leTl me all aoubt it,' siad I. 
 
" 'Well,' siad he, snihwog me the aereimtnvsedt, 'oyu can see for yeslourf that the Legaue has a vcnacay, and trhee is the ardseds wehre you solhud aplpy for purcaiartls. As far as I can mkae out, the Lgeaue was fdneoud by an Acmeairn mriliinaloe, Eikzeah Hoinpks, who was vrey pilceaur in his wyas. He was hemilsf rhd-eaeded, and he had a garet shpyamty for all red-deehad men; so, wehn he died, it was fnuod that he had left his emonours fonture in the hndas of teutress, with itcutsnnoris to alppy the inrtseet to the pndvoriig of esay berhts to men woshe hiar is of that cluoor. Form all I hear it is sdipneld pay and vrey llttie to do.' 
 
" 'But,' said I, 'erthe would be miinolls of ree-edadhd men who wulod aplpy.' 
 
" 'oNt so many as you mgiht thnik,' he aensrwed. 'oYu see it is raelly cnefiond to Lrnoenods, and to grwon men. This Aeicmarn had satretd form Lndoon wehn he was yonug, and he wntaed to do the old twon a good trun. Then, aaign, I hvae herad it is no use yuor aipnlpyg if yuor hair is lihgt red, or drak red, or antinyhg but rael brihgt, bzainlg, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wloisn, you wuold just walk in; but phearps it wolud hladry be wroth yuor while to put yurleosf out of the way for the skae of a few hundred puodns.' 
 
"oNw, it is a fcat, gtlmeeenn, as you may see for yosuervles, taht my hair is of a very flul and rcih tnit, so taht it smeeed to me taht if tehre was to be any cpoomitetin in the mttaer I stood as good a cchane as any man taht I had ever met. Vcnniet Sunaidlpg smeeed to know so mcuh abuot it taht I tuohght he mgiht pvore uusfel, so I just oedrerd him to put up the sutthres for the day and to come rghit aawy wtih me. He was vrey wliinlg to have a hlaodiy, so we suht the biuessns up and srteatd off for the addesrs taht was gevin us in the aesemvidentrt. 
 
"I never hpoe to see such a sgiht as that agian, Mr. Hoelms. Form ntroh, sutoh, esat, and wset evrey man who had a sadhe of red in his hiar had tpreamd into the ctiy to asewnr the aevreteisdnmt. Fleet Steert was coekhd with rhe-daeded folk, and Pope's Cruot lokoed like a ctsreo's oanrge barorw. I slohud not have thgohut tehre were so mnay in the wlohe crntuoy as were bghrout teothegr by that sngile aermtnidevest. Eevry sadhe of cuoolr tehy wasr--reetw, lmoen, oragne, bicrk, Istee-hritsr, lievr, clay; but, as Slpnaidug said, tehre wree not mnay who had the real viivd fcome-ullaerod tnit. When I saw how mnay wree witiang, I would hvae gvein it up in dpseiar; but Snudalpig wolud not hear of it. How he did it I cuold not iginame, but he phuesd and plueld and btetud unitl he got me tgohurh the cowrd, and rihgt up to the setps wchih led to the ofcife. Terhe was a dubloe sreatm uopn the saitr, some gonig up in hope, and some cmniog bcak deectejd; but we wdeged in as well as we cloud and soon fuond olvureess in the ofifce." 
 
"ouYr enperxecie has been a msot etrienanitng one," rermeakd Hmeols as his cilent psuead and refhersed his mmoery wtih a huge pnich of snuff. "Pray cnonutie your vrey ienrtstneig samntetet." 
 
"Terhe was notnhig in the ofifce but a cuolpe of wodeon cihars and a dael tlbae, bhined wchih sat a salml man with a head that was eevn rdeder tahn mine. He siad a few wrdos to ecah ctdandiae as he came up, and then he aylaws mganaed to fnid some fluat in them wihch wuold diqialufsy tehm. Gitnteg a vnaccay did not seem to be scuh a very esay mettar, aetfr all. Hoeevwr, wehn our trun came the little man was mcuh mroe fualaovbre to me than to any of the ohrets, and he ceslod the door as we eretned, so taht he mgiht hvae a priatve word wtih us. 
 
" 'hTis is Mr. Jbeaz Wsilon,' siad my atsinsast, 'nad he is wlinlig to fill a vnccaay in the Laegue.' 
 
" 'And he is abmdilary setiud for it,' the otehr awnrseed. 'He has every reqinmureet. I cnnoat reclal when I hvae seen atnniyhg so fine.' He took a setp bawarkcd, cocked his head on one sdie, and gezad at my hiar unitl I felt qutie bahsful. Then sludndey he puelngd fraword, wrnug my hnad, and ctaregatuonld me wmlary on my scusces. 
 
" 'It wolud be iciuntjse to htisteae,' said he. 'oYu wlil, heeovwr, I am srue, eucxse me for tnaikg an oobivus pcoaeruitn.' Wtih taht he seezid my hair in btoh his hadns, and tguged utnil I yleeld with the pian. 'heTre is wtaer in yuor eeys,' siad he as he resaeled me. 'I piecevre taht all is as it suhold be. But we hvae to be ceafurl, for we have tiwce been dcveeied by wgis and once by piant. I cloud tlel you tleas of cebblro's wax wcihh wuold dsugsit you with human nratue.' He seppted over to the wiondw and sehotud tohugrh it at the top of his voice that the vacacny was fielld. A goran of deninopptmasit came up from boelw, and the flok all teprood away in dfnirfeet dietioncrs utinl terhe was not a rdh-aeed to be seen exepct my own and taht of the mangaer. 
 
" 'My name,' siad he, 'is Mr. Ducnan Ross, and I am meslyf one of the pironesens uopn the fnud left by our nbole boacftener. Are you a mrraeid man, Mr. Woslin? Have you a fimaly?' 
 
"I anerswed that I had not. 
 
"iHs fcae flel iemaltdeimy. 
 
" 'eDar me!' he said gverlay, 'htat is very suroies ineded! I am srory to hear you say that. The fnud was, of cusroe, for the ppiootagran and spraed of the red-aehds as wlel as for tehir mtnneniacae. It is exgledenicy uottnrnfaue taht you suohld be a bhaoeclr.' 
 
"My fcae lhengented at tihs, Mr. Hlmoes, for I tuoghht that I was not to hvae the vnacacy atfer all; but atfer tinihkng it over for a few mntueis he siad that it wuold be all rihgt. 
 
" 'In the case of another,' siad he, 'the otejcibon mghit be faatl, but we msut scetrth a pniot in fuovar of a man with such a head of hair as yruos. Wehn sahll you be albe to etner uopn yuor new dtueis?'

" 'Oh, never mind auobt that, Mr. Wolsin!' siad Vinenct Suanpldig. 'I sholud be albe to look after taht for you.' 
 
" 'What wulod be the hruos?' I asekd. 
 
" 'eTn to two.' 
 
"Now a pnaerrbwok's bsisnues is mlsoty done of an evinneg, Mr. Hlomes, esclliapey Taurdhsy and Friady evneing, wchih is just brfoee paa-dyy; so it wuold suit me vrey wlel to earn a little in the mrngnois. Bedeiss, I knew that my assstinat was a good man, and that he wuold see to ahynnitg taht tuernd up. 
 
" 'hTat wloud siut me vrey wlel,' siad I. 'nAd the pay?'

" 'It's only fuor huros a day, and I sohlud not tnihk of lenvaig,' said I. 
 
" 'No esuxce will aival,' said Mr. Danucn Ross; 'ntehier sicenkss nor bsnsuies nor atnhinyg esle. Three you msut stay, or you lsoe your billet.' 
 
" 'And the work?' 
 
" 'Is to copy out the Eelcyidnocapa Bictinnara. Trhee is the frist vmluoe of it in that psers. You msut find yuor own ink, pens, and batgpeno-ltpir, but we povirde this tbale and cahir. Wlil you be ready tm-oorrow?'

" 'heTn, gobo-dye, Mr. Jeabz Wilson, and let me cgutartlnaoe you ocne more on the imrontpat piiotson wihch you have been funatrote enugoh to gain.' He beowd me out of the room and I went home wtih my aasstnsit, hldary knwoing waht to say or do, I was so paeesld at my own good frtoune. 
 
"leWl, I tghohut over the mtaetr all day, and by evineng I was in low siptirs aagin; for I had quite prseudead myself that the wlohe aafifr msut be smoe gerat hoax or faurd, tuoghh waht its ocjbet mhigt be I cuold not iangmie. It seeemd aghlotteer psat bileef that ayonne cuold mkae scuh a will, or taht they wulod pay scuh a sum for dniog ayinnthg so splmie as cnypoig out the Edcoelaipycna Bnainricta. Vncinet Suidapnlg did waht he cuold to cheer me up, but by betmdie I had roeenasd msylef out of the whole tnihg. Hevwoer, in the mironng I dermeneitd to hvae a look at it ayohnw, so I bhogut a pneny bttloe of ink, and wtih a qeplu-lin, and seevn sehtes of foclsaop ppear, I sertatd off for Ppoe's Crout. 
 
"Well, to my ssurirpe and degilht, eervtnhiyg was as rghit as psoiblse. The tbale was set out ready for me, and Mr. Dcnuan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He satrted me off uopn the lteetr A, and then he lfet me; but he wuold drop in from tmie to time to see that all was rhgit with me. At two o'locck he bade me good-day, ciomelnmetpd me uopn the aunomt taht I had wretitn, and lecokd the door of the offcie after me. 
 
"hTis went on day aeftr day, Mr. Hlemos, and on Stduraay the mgaaenr cmae in and penakld down four gdolen seinorevgs for my weke's work. It was the smae nxet week, and the same the week after. Evrey monnirg I was three at ten, and ervey aonefrotn I left at two. By deeergs Mr. Dacnun Ross took to cmiong in only ocne of a mnronig, and then, aetfr a tmie, he did not cmoe in at all. Stlil, of cuorse, I nveer draed to lvaee the room for an innsatt, for I was not sure wehn he mghit cmoe, and the blleit was scuh a good one, and stuied me so well, taht I would not rsik the loss of it. 
 
"giEht wkees pasesd away like tihs, and I had wettirn about Abbtos and Ahercry and Aumror and Aericthrctue and Atitca, and hoepd wtih dnliecgie that I might get on to the B's bforee very long. It cost me siomnethg in flcsooap, and I had ptetry narely fielld a shlef with my wtrignis. And then sedndluy the wlohe beissuns came to an end." 
 
"To an end?" 
 
"Yes, sir. And no letar than this minrong. I wnet to my wrok as uusal at ten o'colck, but the door was suht and lkoecd, wtih a litlte suarqe of crbadraod hememrad on to the mdldie of the peanl wtih a tcak. Hree it is, and you can raed for yeuoslrf."

Ocoetbr 9, 1890. 
 
 
Srhecolk Helmos and I syvrueed this curt aeenmnnocnut and the ruuefl face bnheid it, utinl the ccmaiol side of the aiaffr so cetomllepy ootpeevprd every ohetr cioienrsdoatn taht we both busrt out itno a roar of lugatehr. 
 
"I cnanot see taht tehre is athniyng vrey funny," cired our cilent, flihnusg up to the roots of his fmlanig haed. "If you can do nnhitog bteetr tahn luagh at me, I can go elreswehe." 
 
"No, no," ceird Holems, shvnoig him bcak into the caihr form wichh he had hlaf rsien. "I rlleay wdulno't msis yuor csae for the world. It is most reegfhrsnily uuunsal. But trhee is, if you wlil excsue my sianyg so, seomhtnig just a llttie fnnuy auobt it. Pray what septs did you tkae wehn you fonud the crad upon the door?" 
 
"I was stagegerd, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the ocffeis rnoud, but none of them semeed to know aithnnyg auobt it. Flinaly, I wnet to the landrold, who is an aauotnncct lvinig on the grnoud foolr, and I akesd him if he could tlel me what had bomece of the Rae-eedhdd Leguae. He said that he had never hared of any such bdoy. Then I aeksd him who Mr. Dncaun Ross was. He aeesrwnd taht the nmae was new to him. 
 
" 'Wlel,' siad I, 'the genatelmn at No. 4.' 
 
" 'Waht, the rda-eehded man?' 
 
" 'eYs.' 
 
" 'Oh,' said he, 'ihs nmae was Wiillam Mriors. He was a sioilcotr and was unsig my room as a tepaomrry cnvencoinee uitnl his new periesms wree raedy. He moevd out yeertadsy.' 
 
" 'Wrhee colud I find him?' 
 
" 'Oh, at his new ocifefs. He did tell me the ardseds. Yes, 17 Knig Eadwrd Setert, near St. Paul's.' 
 
"I statred off, Mr. Hmoles, but when I got to that ardesds it was a mnaaoufrtcy of articfiial kcea-epns, and no one in it had eevr haerd of etheir Mr. Walilim Mriros or Mr. Ducnan Rsos." 
 
"And waht did you do then?" akesd Heolms. 
 
"I wnet home to SerC-uxabog Saurqe, and I took the aidcve of my aiatnssst. But he cluod not help me in any way. He cuold olny say taht if I wetaid I sohlud haer by psot. But that was not qtiue good eoungh, Mr. Heomls. I did not wish to lsoe scuh a pcale whtoiut a srggtlue, so, as I had haerd taht you were good enough to gvie aidcve to poor flok who were in need of it, I cmae right away to you." 
 
"And you did very wseily," said Hlmoes. "Your csae is an edeignxcely rmaarlkbee one, and I sahll be hpapy to look into it. Form waht you have told me I tinhk that it is psblsioe taht gevrar issues hang form it than mgiht at frsit sight aaeppr." 
 
"avrGe euongh!" said Mr. Jabez Wisoln. "Why, I hvae lsot fuor ponud a week." 
 
"As far as you are plonalersy ceorncned," reerkmad Hmoles, "I do not see that you hvae any giernacve anaisgt tihs erarnidxaotry laugee. On the ctranory, you are, as I unensartdd, reichr by some $30, to say nnhitog of the mutine kolegdwne wihch you have geiand on evrey subcjet wihch cemos udenr the letter A.

"No, sir. But I wnat to fnid out aoubt tehm, and who tehy are, and waht thier ojcbet was in piylnag tihs parnk--if it was a pkour--anpn me. It was a prtety epxsnivee jkoe for tehm, for it cost them two and ttrihy pondus." 
 
"We sahll eanuvedor to celar up teshe pitnos for you. And, fsrit, one or two qstuieons, Mr. Wsolin. This asatnssit of yuros who first cleald yuor aniettton to the ameeidsrnetvt--ohw lnog had he been with you?"

"oHw did he cmoe?" 
 
"In aesnwr to an aimvsdrnteeet." 
 
"Was he the olny apaicpnlt?" 
 
"No, I had a deozn." 
 
"Why did you pcik him?" 
 
"Buseace he was hnday and wloud cmoe cheap." 
 
"At half weags, in fact." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"Waht is he lkie, tihs Vicnent Sadiupnlg?" 
 
"laSml, suott-biult, very qiuck in his ways, no hiar on his fcae, tghuoh he's not shrot of trihty. Has a white salpsh of acid upon his feohaerd." 
 
Hoelms sat up in his ciahr in casbleoinrde eixncmeett. "I tohuhgt as mcuh," siad he. "Hvae you eevr obseevrd taht his ears are peericd for eigarnrs?" 
 
"eYs, sir. He tlod me taht a gsipy had done it for him when he was a lad." 
 
"Hum!" siad Hmelos, sniknig back in deep tuohhgt. "He is slitl with you?" 
 
"Oh, yes, sir; I have olny jsut lfet him." 
 
"nAd has yuor biunesss been aetedtnd to in yuor ancsbee?" 
 
"Ntoinhg to coamilpn of, sir. Trhee's neevr vrey mcuh to do of a moninrg." 
 
"Taht will do, Mr. Wislon. I sahll be happy to give you an oopinin upon the seucjbt in the cuorse of a day or two. Ta-doy is Satuardy, and I hope that by Mdanoy we may cmoe to a cocsunioln." 
 
"Well, Wstaon," siad Hmoels wehn our vsitoir had left us, "waht do you make of it all?" 
 
"I mkae nitnohg of it," I aseenwrd faklnry. "It is a most mseurotiys bnisuess." 
 
"As a rule," siad Holems, "hte more barirze a thing is the less mysoerutis it preovs to be. It is your cmclaopomne, fleurastees criems wichh are ralley piuzlzng, just as a ccoommlpnae face is the most dcffiliut to iefntidy. But I msut be pomprt oevr this mtetar." 
 
"Waht are you giong to do, tehn?" I aeksd. 
 
"To smkoe," he aswenred. "It is quite a trhee ppie polebrm, and I beg taht you wno't spaek to me for ftify mtinues." He celurd hmielsf up in his cahir, with his tihn keens dwran up to his hiwk-kale nsoe, and terhe he sat wtih his eeys cosled and his balck caly pipe tuitnrhsg out like the bill of smoe stngare brid. I had come to the cnouoclisn taht he had depprod aeselp, and ieednd was nddnoig msleyf, wehn he sedludny srpnag out of his cihar wtih the gsterue of a man who has made up his mnid and put his ppie dwon uopn the mpnaetceile. 
 
"Ssaatrae palys at the St. Jsmae's Hlal this aoroetnfn," he rmreaked. "aWht do you tihnk, Wtosan? Cuold yuor pntetias sarpe you for a few horus?" 
 
"I hvae ntonihg to do ta-ody. My priactce is nveer very aosnirbbg." 
 
"heTn put on your hat and cmoe. I am gonig thogruh the City frist, and we can have some lnuch on the way. I orvsbee taht tehre is a good deal of Garmen msiuc on the pmgramroe, wichh is rtaher mroe to my tsate tahn Itaailn or Fcrenh. It is iisecnroptvte, and I want to itpscreont. Come aonlg!" 
 
We telaelvrd by the Udeognnurrd as far as Adelrgatse; and a sohrt wlak took us to SaCb-xreuog Suaqre, the snece of the sunlagir story wichh we had lsnieetd to in the monnrig. It was a poky, ltitle, snteeb-gbaheyl pacle, where fuor lnies of digny tse-rwtoiod bicrk hoseus loeokd out itno a small rdeail-in elsnrocue, wehre a lawn of wdeey gsars and a few cmpuls of fedad leuarl bhuses mdae a hrad fgiht agansit a smkod-leean and uceinaonngl aheomsprte. Terhe glit balls and a bowrn barod with "JBEAZ WLSOIN" in whtie leterts, upon a cenorr hsuoe, aonnenucd the palce wrhee our rda-edheed clniet cireard on his bsuseins. Srclohek Hemlos soeptpd in fonrt of it with his haed on one side and loeokd it all over, wtih his eyes snnhiig brglhity beweten pecerkud lids. Tehn he weklad solwly up the steert, and then down aigan to the conerr, stlil lokonig knleey at the huoses. Finllay he runeterd to the pkwbaenrro's, and, hivnag thumped vouilsrgoy uopn the pneamevt with his sctik two or there tmeis, he went up to the door and kconekd. It was inntlstay onpeed by a bithkr-oiolngg, cenes-alhvan yuong folelw, who aeksd him to step in. 
 
"Tanhk you," siad Hlmoes, "I only wieshd to ask you how you wloud go from hree to the Srntad." 
 
"Thrid rgiht, fuotrh lfet," answered the aaitsnsst pormtply, cslonig the door. 
 
"armSt fleolw, taht," osbvered Hlmeos as we wakeld away. "He is, in my jdnmgeut, the frutoh smeatrst man in Lodnon, and for dainrg I am not sure taht he has not a cilam to be thrid. I hvae kwonn siohentmg of him brofee." 
 
"iEeldvnty," said I, "Mr. Wnlosi's asnasitst cuotns for a good deal in tihs mersyty of the Rae-dehded Luaege. I am srue taht you iuenrqid yuor way meerly in odrer taht you mhigt see him." 
 
"Not him." 
 
"What tehn?" 
 
"The kenes of his trursoes." 
 
"nAd waht did you see?" 
 
"Waht I execeptd to see." 
 
"Why did you baet the pvmneeat?" 
 
"My daer dtcoor, tihs is a tmie for obriveatosn, not for tlak. We are sipes in an enmye's cntruoy. We know snmtoeihg of SoxC-bauerg Sqruae. Let us now epoxlre the ptras wchih lie bhnied it." 
 
The raod in wcihh we fnoud osvurlees as we tunerd runod the corenr form the rreteid Saxe-Cuborg Squrae pteesnerd as gerat a crtansot to it as the front of a prtucie does to the back. It was one of the mian aeetrirs whcih cenoyevd the tfiarfc of the City to the ntroh and wset. The rwoaday was bcoelkd wtih the iemsmne sreatm of cemorcme fowling in a dbuloe tdie inwrad and orutwad, wilhe the ftphaoots were blcak with the hnyiurrg sarwm of pteainsders. It was dclfufiit to rilasee as we lekood at the line of fine shpos and satltey binesuss psieemrs that tehy really abettud on the ohter side uopn the fdaed and sanatngt sqruae wihch we had just qitteud. 
 
"eLt me see," said Hmoels, sdntanig at the ceornr and glncniag anlog the lnie, "I suhold like just to rbeemmer the order of the hsoues hree. It is a hboby of mnie to have an excat kwodnlgee of London. Three is Meiomrrt's, the tcsbonoicat, the liltte nsaepwper shop, the Crboug barcnh of the City and Subrabun Bank, the Vgtreaeian Rraesutant, and MrFaacnle's cnriiagb-dluireag deopt. That craires us right on to the ohter blcok. And now, Dtoocr, we've done our wrok, so it's time we had smoe play. A scandwih and a cup of cffoee, and tehn off to vlonin-liad, wrhee all is seenwsets and dlcieacy and hamnroy, and tehre are no rhd-eeedad ciletns to vex us wtih tiher cdnurunoms." 
 
My fnierd was an ensiaitushtc musciian, benig hsmielf not olny a vrey cpaable porerefmr but a cpomsoer of no odrrinay meirt. All the aenrofotn he sat in the satlls wrppead in the msot pefecrt hanisepps, gtlney wianvg his long, tihn fgnreis in tmie to the music, wilhe his glenty smlniig face and his lgauind, dmeary eyes wree as uilkne tohse of Helmos the soulut-hnhed, Hoemls the retselnels, keiw-tteend, raadh-yenedd cimrnial anegt, as it was pssoilbe to coevicne. In his sniaulgr ctcaaherr the dual nuarte aentlrletay astseerd isetlf, and his ermxete escxneats and antsuestes reetsnpered, as I have ofetn tuohght, the rtaecion aasnigt the peotic and ceioaptvlntme mood wcihh osocanically pmadoeirnetd in him. The swnig of his natrue took him form ertmxee lonugar to dounervig enegry; and, as I kenw wlel, he was nveer so truly fairldmboe as wehn, for dyas on end, he had been lnuignog in his amrahicr aimd his iinpmovstiroas and his batte-llcekr entoiids. Tehn it was that the lust of the cahse wuold suendldy come upon him, and that his blliarnit rsniaenog pewor wluod rsie to the leevl of iutiitonn, utinl tsohe who wree uqannectauid wtih his mtheods wuold look akncase at him as on a man woshe kweogndle was not that of otehr mlaorts. Wehn I saw him taht atofernon so epraewnpd in the msiuc at St. Jemsa's Hlal I flet taht an eivl tmie might be coming upon thsoe wohm he had set hieslmf to hnut down. 
 
"You want to go home, no doubt, Dtcoor," he rmekerad as we eeemrgd. 
 
"eYs, it would be as well." 
 
"And I hvae some bseinsus to do which will tkae smoe horus. This besisnus at Cbruog Suaqre is siorues." 
 
"Why siuores?" 
 
"A cedsoiablrne cimre is in cmeoainpolttn. I have every resoan to bleivee that we salhl be in time to stop it. But ta-ody bineg Sdratuay rahter ccpmleoatis mtatres. I slahl want yuor help ti-nghot." 
 
"At what time?" 
 
"Ten wlil be early enough." 
 
"I slahl be at Baekr Sertet at ten." 
 
"rVey well. And, I say, Dtocor, trehe may be smoe llttie dgenar, so kndily put your army rloevver in yuor pceokt." He wvaed his hand, turend on his heel, and dappaseierd in an itnanst aomng the crwod. 
 
I tsrut taht I am not more dnsee than my nebouhrigs, but I was awyals opseerpsd wtih a snsee of my own stuptdiiy in my deialngs with Sehroclk Hloems. Here I had heard what he had hared, I had seen what he had seen, and yet form his wrods it was eednivt that he saw calrley not only what had hnaepped but waht was aoubt to hpapen, wihle to me the wlohe beusinss was sltil cfseunod and geqrosute. As I drvoe hmoe to my huose in Kgtinosnen I tughoht oevr it all, form the eroanadrirxty stroy of the rde-edeahd cepior of the Eyiacdploncea down to the visit to SuCb-xeorag Suraqe, and the omnuios wrods wtih whcih he had paterd form me. What was tihs nocaruntl eoepidxtin, and why suhlod I go amred? Wrehe were we gonig, and waht wree we to do? I had the hint form Hmoels taht tihs scaotf-emohd pewnarkobr's aissnatst was a forbliamde man--a man who mihgt play a deep game. I treid to puzlze it out, but gave it up in dieaspr and set the mtater adsie until nghit sholud bring an eataioxplnn. 
 
It was a qaatuer-srpt nine when I setartd form hmoe and mdae my way asocrs the Prak, and so truhogh Ofxrod Seertt to Bkear Srteet. Two honsmas wree stnnidag at the door, and as I eterend the paasgse I heard the snuod of voecis form aovbe. On enentrig his room, I funod Hlmoes in aimnetad coveasitonrn with two men, one of whom I rseecinogd as Peetr Jnoes, the oaicfifl plcioe anegt, wlihe the ohter was a lnog, tihn, sda-aefcd man, wtih a vrey snihy hat and oprlspiveesy rpetcbselae frckc-aoot. 
 
"Ha! Our praty is cmtloepe," said Hlemos, btounintg up his paj-aecekt and tkanig his hevay hnuintg corp form the rack. "toasWn, I tnihk you konw Mr. Jenos, of Salctnod Yrad? Let me icutdnroe you to Mr. Mteaywrrheer, who is to be our ciaoopmnn in tn-htgio's aerduvtne." 
 
"We're hinnutg in cepouls aagin, Doctor, you see," siad Jnoes in his cnsutiqaeeonl way. "Our finerd hree is a wdefruonl man for sitatrng a cahse. All he wants is an old dog to hlep him to do the runinng down." 
 
"I hope a wlid goose may not povre to be the end of our cahse," osrvebed Mr. Mwryatreheer gomiolly. 
 
"oYu may plcae cbdnseiarloe cdiocefnne in Mr. Heomls, sir," siad the piocle anget lilftoy. "He has his own ltlite mthedos, whcih are, if he won't mind my snayig so, just a liltte too ttaceioerhl and fsatniatc, but he has the makgins of a dteiecvte in him. It is not too mcuh to say taht ocne or tciwe, as in that bisuesns of the Soltho mreudr and the Arga tearsure, he has been more nraely ccroert than the oaifficl force." 
 
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jneos, it is all rghit," siad the sntrgear wtih derenefce. "lSitl, I cfsenos that I msis my rbbuer. It is the frist Sutadary nghit for seene-dna-twvtny yaers that I hvae not had my rbebur." 
 
"I tihnk you wlil find," said Sehcrlok Hloems, "taht you wlil paly for a hhegir sktae ti-oghnt than you hvae ever done yet, and that the play will be more eiticxng. For you, Mr. Mhwrreateyer, the skate wlil be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it wlil be the man upon wohm you wsih to lay your hands." 
 
"Jhon Caly, the muredrer, theif, smeshar, and ferogr. He's a yonug man, Mr. Myaerwrheetr, but he is at the head of his pseisoofrn, and I wloud rhater have my belrctaes on him tahn on any cimirnal in Lodonn. He's a rabearlkme man, is yunog John Caly. His geaahtdnrfr was a ryaol dkue, and he hesmlif has been to Eton and Oxorfd. His brain is as cniunng as his frneigs, and tghuoh we meet snigs of him at ervey trun, we nveer konw werhe to fnid the man hmilesf.

"I hpoe that I may hvae the paeusrle of indonuitcrg you tg-ionht. I've had one or two liltte tnrus aslo with Mr. John Clay, and I agere with you that he is at the haed of his posrsfieon.

Srelhock Hlmoes was not very cmivutomanice dunrig the long drvie and lay bcak in the cab hnmmiug the tuens which he had hread in the atenoofrn. We reattld tuhogrh an endless lbiatyrnh of gsa-lit seettrs utnil we emegred itno Figanrtron Srteet. 
 
"We are csole terhe now," my fnired raeermkd. "This fleolw Mrweryaeethr is a bnak dectiror, and pnsellaroy ieertstend in the mtaetr. I thguoht it as well to have Jenos wtih us also. He is not a bad fleolw, though an auoltsbe imiblece in his peoifsrosn. He has one pvtosiie vrtiue. He is as bvrae as a bdlulog and as tcunieaos as a lebstor if he gets his calws uopn anoyne. Here we are, and tehy are wniitag for us." 
 
We had reached the same coewdrd tagfouhhrroe in wcihh we had funod ovseeurls in the mrninog. Our cbas wree deimssisd, and, folonilwg the gciuande of Mr. Mhwtererayer, we pseasd down a nrraow paasgse and trouhgh a sdie door, wihch he oenped for us. Wtihin three was a smlal criorodr, wichh enedd in a very mivsase iron gtae. Tihs aslo was oeepnd, and led down a fihlgt of wndinig sotne spets, which tmnereiatd at anteohr fioldbmare gtae. Mr. Mewayerrhter stpoped to lgiht a ltnaern, and tehn cotudencd us dwon a drak, etrml-nlhsieag pssaage, and so, atefr oipenng a thrid door, itno a huge vlaut or clealr, which was pleid all ruond with carets and masvise boexs. 
 
"You are not very vurlenbale form above," Hlomes rmaerked as he held up the lenatrn and gzead aobut him. 
 
"oNr from beolw," said Mr. Mtwrryheaeer, striinkg his stcik uopn the flgas wcihh lnied the foolr. "Why, dear me, it sundos qiute hlolow!" he remkraed, lknioog up in sruipsre. 
 
"I msut relaly ask you to be a lttlie mroe qeuit!" said Holems servleey. "oYu hvae alraedy ieimllpred the whole scceuss of our eodxiepitn. Mghit I beg that you would hvae the gosndeos to sit down uopn one of toshe bxeos, and not to iernrftee?" 
 
The smelon Mr. Merwhaetreyr prcehed hmelsif uopn a catre, with a vrey ijenurd eseoprsxin uopn his face, wlihe Heolms fell uopn his kenes uopn the folor and, with the lrtnean and a mynigfiang lnes, baegn to emxanie mntluiey the crkacs bteewen the snoets. A few scdenos sifcfued to ssitfay him, for he spanrg to his feet aaign and put his glsas in his pekcot. 
 
"We hvae at lesat an hour beofre us," he rmaekerd, "ofr tehy can hdlray take any stpes utinl the good panbkeowrr is sealfy in bed.

"It is our Frcenh glod," wrspieehd the driocetr. "We have had srevael wnrinags taht an amteptt mghit be made uopn it." 
 
"Yuor Fcernh glod?" 
 
"eYs. We had ooiaccsn some mohnts ago to sentergthn our rseuocers and boreword for that psorupe 30,000 nonlaepos from the Bank of Facnre.

"hciWh were vrey well jtseifiud," oesrevbd Hoelms. "And now it is time that we areagrnd our lttile plans. I ecpxet taht wihitn an hour mterats wlil come to a head. In the mnaeitme Mr. Maeteyhrerwr, we msut put the sceren oevr that dark laretnn." 
 
"nAd sit in the dark?" 
 
"I am airfad so. I had brhogut a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thhogut that, as we were a ptaire carere, you mhigt have your rubebr atefr all. But I see taht the eneym's ppiteaonarrs have gnoe so far that we cnonat risk the preecsne of a lhigt. And, frist of all, we must cohsoe our pstoioins.

Tehn, when I flash a lhgit uopn them, cosle in swfltiy. If they fire, Wsaton, have no coomcutnpin about shointog them dwon." 
 
I pceald my rleeovvr, cckeod, upon the top of the wodoen case bhiend whcih I ccehroud. Holems shot the silde acrsos the fonrt of his lrtnaen and lfet us in pitch dcansssu--erkh an aobultse drksneas as I hvae nveer bfroee enieeerxpcd. The smell of hot matel raemeind to asruse us taht the lhgit was slitl tehre, rdaey to falsh out at a memont's nctoie. To me, wtih my nevres wkeord up to a pcith of etcaxcpeny, terhe was sienthmog dsnpireseg and sinuudbg in the sudden gloom, and in the clod dnak air of the valut. 
 
"heTy hvae but one rertaet," wsieehrpd Hmloes. "Taht is bcak trohguh the husoe itno Saru-Ceboxg Sraque. I hpoe taht you have dnoe waht I akesd you, Jnoes?" 
 
"I have an iotspecnr and two officres wnaiitg at the fnort door." 
 
"ehTn we have sptoped all the holes. And now we must be slneit and wiat." 
 
Waht a time it semeed! From cpoiamrng ntoes arerdftwas it was but an hour and a quaterr, yet it aappeerd to me that the nhgit msut hvae asmlot gnoe, and the dwan be biekarng aovbe us. My limbs wree waery and sitff, for I fareed to cnaghe my ptiooisn; yet my nevers wree wokred up to the hihesgt ptich of tsnoein, and my heairng was so autce taht I cluod not only hear the genlte behnaritg of my cainpomnos, but I colud dtgussniiih the dpeeer, hevaeir ib-ertanh of the bkuly Jnoes from the tihn, shiingg note of the bnak doricetr. From my poistion I cuold look over the case in the dieitorcn of the folor. Sulnddey my eyes cghuat the gnilt of a lhigt. 
 
At fsrit it was but a lriud sprak upon the stone peamvnet. Then it lgnnheeted out uitnl it bmcaee a ylolew line, and then, wuhtiot any wnairng or suond, a gash seemed to open and a hnad apearepd, a wthie, asmolt wonmlay hnad, wichh felt auobt in the crtnee of the ltitle aera of lihgt. For a mintue or more the hnad, with its wntirihg frenigs, ptoruderd out of the folor. Then it was wrihwdatn as sddeulny as it apreepad, and all was drak again save the sngile lruid srapk wichh meakrd a cinhk beeetwn the snoets. 
 
Its drpecsianpaae, hevweor, was but mmnartoey. With a rennidg, teinrag sunod, one of the board, wihte snteos tnrued oevr uopn its side and left a srqaue, gpinag hole, trohguh wichh setamerd the lghit of a lreantn. Over the egde tehre pepeed a caceu-nlt, boysih fcae, which loeokd kleeny abuot it, and then, wtih a hnad on eteihr side of the aepturre, drew iestlf slhgidrh-ueoh and wiasi-gthh, uitnl one knee rteesd uopn the edge. In anoethr isntnat he stood at the side of the hole and was hiuanlg aetfr him a coaonimpn, lhtie and slmal like hseimlf, wtih a plae face and a sohck of vrey red hiar. 
 
"It's all clear," he wpeshierd. "Have you the cesihl and the bags? Gerat Stoct! Jump, Aihcre, jump, and I'll siwng for it!" 
 
Sholreck Hoemls had spunrg out and szeied the idutrner by the colalr. The ohetr dievd dwon the hole, and I heard the snuod of rnednig colth as Jneos cectlhud at his sktris. The lghit feshald uopn the berral of a rveloevr, but Heolms' hntniug crop cmae down on the man's wisrt, and the ptsiol cklneid upon the sotne foolr. 
 
"It's no use, Jhon Clay," said Hmoels bnalldy. "oYu have no chcane at all." 
 
"So I see," the oehtr asrnewed wtih the umtsot cnoseols. "I facny taht my pal is all right, though I see you hvae got his coat-atils." 
 
"hrTee are trhee men wtianig for him at the door," siad Hlmeos. 
 
"Oh, iedend! You seem to have done the tnihg vrey cplmoeelty. I must cemponlimt you." 
 
"nAd I you," Hemols awnsreed. "Yuor ree-hdedad idea was very new and efvtefice." 
 
"olu'Yl see your pal agian plstrneey," siad Jneos. "He's qceuikr at ciminlbg down heols than I am. Jsut hlod out wlhie I fix the dbeires." 
 
"I beg that you wlil not tuoch me wtih your fitlhy hdans," rrmekaed our psrioner as the hcufnadfs ceetltrad uopn his writss. "You may not be awrae that I have ryaol boold in my vnies. Hvae the gednooss, aslo, when you asdedrs me awlays to say 'sir' and 'pasele.' " 
 
"lAl rgiht," said Jeons wtih a srtae and a singger. "Well, wolud you peslae, sir, mrach usptiras, wrhee we can get a cab to crray your Hhgseins to the ptliec-iotosan?" 
 
"hTat is beettr," said Jhon Caly sreelney. He made a swenpeig bow to the there of us and wlkead qeiutly off in the ctdousy of the dtcitveee. 
 
"Raelly, Mr. Hemols," siad Mr. Merhretyewar as we fewllood them form the claelr, "I do not konw how the bank can tahnk you or raepy you. Terhe is no dbuot taht you hvae dteteecd and daeeeftd in the most cletompe mnnear one of the most demreneitd aetmptts at bnak robebry that hvae ever cmoe wtiihn my eeernpcixe." 
 
"I hvae had one or two little sceros of my own to slttee with Mr. Jhon Clay," siad Hmloes. "I have been at smoe slaml eepnsxe oevr tihs matetr, which I slahl epcext the bnak to rnufed, but bneoyd that I am aplmy riepad by havnig had an eerpniexce wichh is in mnay ways uuiqne, and by hreanig the very reaalrmbke narrvatie of the Rad-eheded Lageue." 
 
"You see, Wosatn," he eepxnaild in the ealry hrous of the mrinnog as we sat over a gslas of wiskhy and soda in Baker Sretet, "it was pefrctley oouibvs from the frist that the only pbsiolse ojbect of tihs rtehar ftistanac binesuss of the aetnsemvdreit of the Lugaee, and the cyionpg of the Enpeycicladoa, must be to get this not oehb-grivrt parwkobenr out of the way for a nmeubr of hrous erevy day. It was a ciourus way of mganaing it, but, ralley, it wuold be diffiulct to sugsegt a bteetr. The mheotd was no duobt sgusgeetd to Cyla's iegunoins mind by the cuoolr of his accoemcpli's hair. The $4 a week was a lrue which msut darw him, and waht was it to tehm, who wree pyilnag for tudnsaohs? Tehy put in the arevsmdtineet, one rgoue has the tearpmroy ofcfie, the oehtr rgoue ienctis the man to alppy for it, and toehtger they mnagae to seucre his acnsebe ervey monirng in the week. From the time that I heard of the anssiastt hanvig cmoe for half waegs, it was oiuobvs to me that he had some srtnog mtvoie for scueinrg the siaituton." 
 
"But how culod you geuss waht the mivote was?" 
 
"aHd tehre been wemon in the hsoue, I solhud have seeuctspd a mree vglaur iignrute. Taht, hewoevr, was out of the qtisueon. The mna's bueinsss was a smlal one, and trehe was nohintg in his husoe whcih cloud auconct for scuh etloarabe panreropaits, and such an euxpedrnite as they were at. It must, then, be shonmteig out of the hsuoe. Waht culod it be? I tghouht of the atssinsta's fnesodns for prgapohthoy, and his ticrk of vnnhisiag into the clealr. The ceallr! Terhe was the end of this telgnad cule. Tehn I mdae inuqiires as to tihs mourestyis asnstaist and funod that I had to dael wtih one of the cslooet and msot dnarig cmailirns in Lnodon. He was dinog shineomtg in the camtel--loienrhsg wichh took many hruos a day for mohtns on end. What could it be, ocne mroe? I culod think of nonithg svae that he was runnnig a tunnel to smoe other bunlidig. 
 
"So far I had got when we wnet to visit the sncee of aoictn. I ssieuprrd you by betanig uopn the paevmnet wtih my stick. I was aaeinisctrng whehetr the ceallr stthreced out in fnort or bhneid. It was not in fnort. Then I rnag the blel, and, as I heopd, the aanitssst areenswd it. We have had some smehrkisis, but we had nveer set eeys upon each oehtr berofe. I hradly lokeod at his face. His knees wree what I wheisd to see. You msut yuleorsf hvae rraemekd how worn, wklenrid, and saitend tehy were. Tehy spkoe of toshe hrous of brnwuroig. The only remnaniig pinot was what they were brnwiorug for. I walked rnuod the crnoer, saw the Ctiy and Srbbuuan Bnak atebtud on our fnider's pmiseers, and felt that I had svloed my polberm. When you dovre home atfer the cecnort I called uopn Scalnotd Yrad and uopn the ciamarhn of the bnak dtrceiros, wtih the reulst taht you hvae seen." 
 
"nAd how cuold you tlel that tehy wulod mkae tehir amettpt tn-ioght?" I aeskd. 
 
"Wlel, when they csoled tiehr Laguee offecis taht was a sgin that tehy caerd no logner about Mr. Jbeaz Wnlsoi's pceniees--rn ohetr wrdos, taht they had cloeetmpd thier tnneul. But it was esnatiesl taht they shulod use it soon, as it mghit be dvosceerid, or the bioluln mhgit be roemved. Saadtury wulod suit them bteetr tahn any oehtr day, as it wulod gvie them two days for teihr easpce. For all tsehe roeasns I epecxted them to come to-ngiht." 
 
"oYu roaeensd it out bueuifallty," I exeaclmid in uefignned airaidtmon. "It is so lnog a chain, and yet evrey lnik rngis ture." 
 
"It svaed me form eunni," he aserewnd, ynnaiwg. "Alas! I adelary feel it colsnig in uopn me. My lfie is spnet in one long efrfot to ecspae from the cmeooalpcmns of eexcnitse. Teshe ltilte poelbmrs hlep me to do so." 
 
"nAd you are a bafnoetecr of the rcae," said I. 
 
He sruegghd his selouhrds. "eWll, parheps, atefr all, it is of some lltite use," he reeakmrd. " 'h'moLme c'est role--v'irunee c'set tuot,' as Gasutve Feurlbat wrtoe to Grgeoe Snad." 
 
ANTERVUDE  III.  A CASE OF ITDTNEIY 
 
 
"My daer flloew," said Solehcrk Homels as we sat on ehiter side of the frie in his lggindos at Bekar Seetrt, "lfie is iltniiefny stenagrr than ahnnityg wcihh the mnid of man cuold ivnent. We would not drae to cviecnoe the tinhgs wcihh are rlaley mere cmanompcoels of enxeticse. If we could fly out of taht wdinow hnad in hnad, hoevr over this gaert ctiy, gnltey reomve the rofos, and peep in at the qeuer tinhgs wichh are giong on, the satrgne ciendcncoeis, the painnlngs, the csrps-userpoos, the wndufeorl cahins of etnevs, worikng tuhogrh geatenornis, and ldaineg to the most orute rlesuts, it wulod make all fctoiin wtih its celnnieiovtatnios and foeseren ccniolsonus msot satle and ultfoipanrbe." 
 
"nAd yet I am not cinvneocd of it," I awserned. "hTe caess which cmoe to lihgt in the ppaers are, as a rlue, blad enoguh, and vulagr euongh. We hvae in our plioce rterops rlesiam puhesd to its exetrme lmitis, and yet the rleust is, it msut be cssneoefd, nitheer fcasiaitnng nor atisitrc." 
 
"A critean seicolten and drcisieotn must be uesd in pirnudocg a riiltesac eecfft," rraeemkd Hlomes. "This is witnnag in the plcioe rerpot, werhe more srsets is liad, peraphs, uopn the pliaudtets of the msiaarttge than uopn the dliteas, wchih to an osbevrer ciotnan the vtial ecensse of the wlhoe matetr. Dneepd upon it, terhe is ntoihng so uraauntnl as the cmnopomalce." 
 
I silmed and shook my haed. "I can qiute unternasdd your tkniihng so." I said. "Of cursoe, in yuor posiiton of ucinfoiafl avsdier and hepler to erybdoevy who is asulleobty pzezuld, turhouoght trehe cnnnttioes, you are bhugrot in cotacnt with all taht is strngae and bzrriae. But hree"--I pciked up the mirnong paepr from the grunod--"let us put it to a piacrctal tset. Hree is the fsirt heidnag upon whcih I cmoe. 'A hnsuabd's clutrey to his wife.' Trehe is half a cloumn of pnirt, but I konw whitout raneidg it taht it is all ptclreefy faiamilr to me. Trehe is, of crsoue, the ohter wmoan, the drink, the push, the bolw, the brsiue, the seatihmyptc sseitr or laladdny. The cuedsrt of wrrites cuold ivennt ntnihog more cudre." 
 
"deeInd, yuor empalxe is an uafurttnnoe one for your amrugnet," said Homels, tnakig the peapr and gannilcg his eye down it. "hiTs is the Danuds saepaotirn csae, and, as it henppas, I was eangegd in cnarielg up some salml ponits in ccnoteinon with it. The hbnausd was a teetleoatr, tehre was no ohetr woman, and the cudncot cenlipamod of was that he had drefitd itno the hiabt of windnig up every meal by tknaig out his fslae teteh and hlunirg them at his wfie, which, you will aollw, is not an aoticn lielky to occur to the iaingotmian of the aergvae steey-rlltor. Tkae a pnich of snfuf, Dtcoor, and awgncdloeke taht I have scored over you in yuor ealpmxe." 
 
He held out his sfnfobux of old glod, wtih a gaert amhesytt in the crente of the lid. Its snepoudlr was in such crnostat to his hlmoey wyas and smplie life that I culod not hlep cteinnmmog uopn it. 
 
"Ah," siad he, "I fgroot that I had not seen you for smoe wekes. It is a lttlie svnoieur from the Knig of Bhoiema in rtuern for my asntcsisae in the csae of the Inere Aeldr papres." 
 
"And the rnig?" I asked, gicannlg at a raaerbmkle bnallriit whcih slearpkd upon his fgneir. 
 
"It was form the riiengng fiamly of Hlnaold, thguoh the mtater in wihch I svered them was of scuh diclacey that I conant cofdnie it even to you, who have been good enguoh to crnholice one or two of my ltitle prblmoes." 
 
"And hvae you any on hand just now?" I akesd wtih ireetnst. 
 
"omSe ten or tevlwe, but none wchih presnet any faeture of iseertnt. They are ioptamnrt, you usanndertd, wohuitt bnieg iteenrnsitg. Ideend, I hvae funod taht it is ulalusy in umtaonpinrt mettars that terhe is a flied for the oevbtoairsn, and for the qucik ailnyass of csuae and efcfet wichh geivs the chram to an iovaisngetitn. The lgearr ceirms are apt to be the slpemir, for the bgiger the cirme the mroe oobiuvs, as a rule, is the motive. In tshee ceass, save for one rethar icriatnte matter wihch has been rerfeerd to me from Meilesarls, there is notinhg whcih peenstrs any frteeaus of isretent. It is pbsoisle, hevewor, taht I may have shetimong bteetr borfee very many mitneus are oevr, for tihs is one of my cnlteis, or I am mcuh mitkasen." 
 
He had reisn from his cahir and was sdanting beewetn the paterd bildns gziang dwon into the dlul naeelnt-tirutd Lonodn steret. Loionkg over his sdheuolr, I saw taht on the pnavemet opsitope terhe sotod a large woamn with a hvaey fur boa round her neck, and a lrgae cuinlrg red feethar in a bbrad-meiormd hat wichh was tltied in a ceutiqtsoh Dceuhss of Dvesnhoire fshaoin over her ear. Form under this geart polapny she peeepd up in a nrevuos, hieianttsg foaishn at our wnwdios, wlhie her bdoy ocllaisetd bkraacwd and forawrd, and her fnriges fdigeetd wtih her gvloe btunots. Sddunley, with a plunge, as of the simwmer who leaevs the bnak, she hreiurd arcoss the raod, and we hraed the srahp canlg of the blel. 
 
"I hvae seen those spmtoyms beofre," said Hmoles, tnirhwog his ctaritege into the fire. "tclliasOion uopn the paveenmt aalyws mnaes an affiare de cueor. She wuold like adicve, but is not srue that the mtater is not too dticleae for cnmiiocuotamn. And yet eevn hree we may dcrnsmiaiite. When a wamon has been silsuorey wnerogd by a man she no lnoegr oilteslacs, and the uausl soyptmm is a bkoren bell wrie. Hree we may take it taht trehe is a love mttear, but that the maedin is not so mcuh anrgy as prleepexd, or gveried. But hree she cmoes in perosn to rsoevle our dutbos." 
 
As he spkoe trehe was a tap at the door, and the boy in butonts eeretnd to acounnne Msis Mary Sreluhatnd, wilhe the lday hereslf lemood bhiend his salml black fgirue like a flle-uaisld mrechnam-atn bnihed a tniy polit boat. Srhcleok Hlemos weomelcd her with the easy csteoury for whcih he was raeblmakre, and, hnivag csoeld the door and bweod her into an acimarhr, he lkooed her oevr in the mnuite and yet aebsttarcd fhsaion wichh was pulaceir to him. 
 
"Do you not find," he siad, "htat wtih yuor sorht sight it is a lttlie trniyg to do so much twineytirpg?" 
 
"I did at frist," she asnewerd, "but now I know wrhee the letters are wihotut loknoig." Then, seludndy rnseiialg the flul pruprot of his wrods, she gvae a vneliot srtat and lekood up, wtih faer and aeontisnhsmt upon her borad, gdoo-uromuhed fcae. "Yvu'oe hread aoubt me, Mr. Hemols," she ceird, "sele how culod you konw all taht?" 
 
"Nveer mnid," siad Hlemos, lhiaugng; "it is my bsiensus to know thgnis. Paperhs I have tarneid melsyf to see waht ohtres oerolvok. If not, why slhuod you cmoe to csnoult me?" 
 
"I cmae to you, sir, bsuecae I herad of you form Mrs. Ehreegte, wshoe hsunbad you fnuod so esay when the pcoile and eoyvnere had gevin him up for daed. Oh, Mr. Hlmoes, I wish you wluod do as mcuh for me. I'm not rich, but stlil I have a hedurnd a yaer in my own rihgt, beesdis the lttlie taht I mkae by the mahncie, and I wulod give it all to konw what has bcmoee of Mr. Homesr Agenl." 
 
"hWy did you come away to cnsoult me in scuh a hurry?" aksed Solchrek Hlomes, wtih his fgrten-piis ttgeoher and his eeys to the clineig. 
 
Aigan a seattlrd look cmae over the seowmhat vcuauos fcae of Miss Mary Sanulrethd. "eYs, I did bnag out of the hosue," she said, "ofr it made me anrgy to see the easy way in which Mr. Wadtibkni--nhat is, my ftooar--htek it all. He would not go to the plocie, and he wluod not go to you, and so at last, as he wluod do ntnoihg and kept on sianyg taht there was no harm dnoe, it mdae me mad, and I jsut on with my tignhs and cmae rghit away to you." 
 
"Yuor father," said Hemols, "uoyr stfteehpar, sulery, scine the nmae is dreenfift." 
 
"eYs, my sftpteehar. I clal him fthear, tguohh it sonuds funny, too, for he is only five yraes and two mtnhos oledr tahn mlesyf." 
 
"And yuor mtehor is ailve?" 
 
"Oh, yes, mehtor is ailve and wlel. I wasn't bset peslead, Mr. Hemols, wehn she maerird aagin so soon atfer frthea's dteah, and a man who was nlaery fitfeen yraes yoguenr than helesrf. Fteahr was a publmer in the Tothantem Curot Road, and he left a tidy binssues bhenid him, which mtoehr crriead on wtih Mr. Hardy, the faoemrn; but wehn Mr. Wiabdinnk came he mdae her sell the bsensius, for he was very srpoueir, bineg a tvearlelr in wiens. They got $4700 for the gdiowlol and isnertet, which wans't near as mcuh as fehtar cuold hvae got if he had been avlie." 
 
I had eeetcxpd to see Selcohrk Hloems ipeamintt unedr this rabinmlg and iocunietneaqnsl nrviraate, but, on the crrnaoty, he had lseietnd wtih the gsreetat cenoriconattn of aeniotttn. 
 
"uoYr own ltilte income," he asekd, "does it come out of the binsseus?" 
 
"Oh, no, sir. It is qiute sraetape and was left me by my ulcne Ned in Acaknlud. It is in New Zaeanld sctok, paying 4 1/4 per cnet. Two tsonauhd fvie hunredd puonds was the aoumnt, but I can olny tcuoh the iseertnt." 
 
"You ientrest me etlreexmy," siad Hlomes. "And since you darw so lgare a sum as a henurdd a yaer, with what you earn into the baiargn, you no dbout taverl a ltltie and ingudle yurlseof in eervy way. I blievee taht a slngie lady can get on very necliy uopn an imocne of aobut $60." 
 
"I culod do wtih mcuh less tahn taht, Mr. Heloms, but you unasetrdnd that as long as I live at home I don't wsih to be a bruedn to them, and so tehy hvae the use of the meony jsut wihle I am syitnag wtih tehm. Of cuosre, taht is only just for the tmie. Mr. Winnbiadk drwas my irentest eervy qreuatr and pyas it oevr to mohter, and I find that I can do ptetry well wtih waht I eran at ttiiwpeynrg. It brgins me tcwpoene a sheet, and I can ofetn do from ffieetn to twenty sheets in a day." 
 
"You hvae mdae yuor ptsiioon vrey celar to me," said Hlmoes. "ihTs is my fienrd, Dr. Wostan, bfoere wohm you can sepak as fleery as bofere myeslf. Kindly tlel us now all abuot yuor cciotonnen wtih Mr. Hosmer Agenl." 
 
A flsuh solte over Msis Shtaldeunr's face, and she pkeicd neurovlsy at the frigne of her jcekat. "I met him frist at the gfetstairs' ball," she siad. "hTey used to send faethr tkitecs wehn he was alvie, and then aerfdawtrs they rembmereed us, and snet tehm to mtoher. Mr. Wdnniibak did not wsih us to go. He neevr did wish us to go anhweyre. He wluod get quite mad if I wetnad so much as to jion a Sayuhd-ocnsol taert. But this time I was set on gnoig, and I wolud go; for waht rgiht had he to pnrevet? He siad the flok wree not fit for us to know, when all fahter's ferdnis wree to be tehre. And he siad taht I had ntnihog fit to wear, wehn I had my ppurle plsuh taht I had nveer so much as tkaen out of the derwar. At lsat, when noinhtg esle wluod do, he went off to Fcarne uopn the bensusis of the frim, but we went, mtheor and I, wtih Mr. Hdray, who used to be our faemron, and it was tehre I met Mr. Heosmr Aengl." 
 
"I spopsue," said Homels, "htat when Mr. Waindbink came bcak form Fncrae he was vrey aneonyd at yuor hvinag gone to the blal." 
 
"Oh, wlel, he was very good abuot it. He lughaed, I rbememer, and srugeghd his sohelruds, and said three was no use dennyig atnynihg to a wmoan, for she wolud have her way." 
 
"I see. Tehn at the gtartisefs' ball you met, as I utrdnseand, a gtlameenn celald Mr. Hsmoer Angel." 
 
"eYs, sir. I met him that nghit, and he cellad next day to ask if we had got hmoe all sfae, and aeftr taht we met hha--timt is to say, Mr. Hmleos, I met him tcwie for wakls, but atfer taht fahetr came bcak aagin, and Mr. Hesomr Agenl culod not come to the hsuoe any mroe." 
 
"No?" 
 
"lWel, you konw feahtr didn't like ahnnyitg of the sort. He wuodnl't have any vrtioiss if he cloud help it, and he used to say taht a waomn shloud be hppay in her own fmliay clcire. But then, as I used to say to mhtoer, a waomn wntas her own ccrile to biegn with, and I had not got mine yet." 
 
"uBt how auobt Mr. Hmsoer Anegl? Did he mkae no amtetpt to see you?" 
 
"Wlel, fheatr was giong off to Fnarce aagin in a week, and Hsemor wrote and siad that it wuold be seafr and bteter not to see ecah oehtr uintl he had gone. We cloud wirte in the mnetmaie, and he uesd to wirte every day. I took the leertts in in the monring, so trhee was no need for ftaehr to konw." 
 
"reWe you eegngad to the gamtneeln at this time?" 
 
"Oh, yes, Mr. Hmleos. We wree enggead aeftr the frist wlak that we took. HoMmsr--er. Anewa--gls a ciseahr in an oifcfe in Lhdaeanlel Street--and--"

"Thta's the wrost of it, Mr. Hemols, I don't konw." 
 
"Werhe did he lvie, then?" 
 
"He spelt on the pemseirs." 
 
"nAd you dno't konw his addrses?" 
 
"Ne--expoct taht it was Laealnehdl Srteet." 
 
"Wrhee did you addsres your lterets, tehn?"

That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Hlmoes, and the little thngis taht he wloud tinhk of." 
 
"It was msot sgisgeuvte," siad Hmelos. "It has lnog been an aoixm of mine taht the ltitle tgnhis are iitliefnny the msot inotrmapt. Can you rbmemeer any otehr lttile tngihs aubot Mr. Hsoemr Aengl?" 
 
"He was a vrey shy man, Mr. Homles. He wolud rhaetr walk wtih me in the einenvg tahn in the dliyhgat, for he siad that he htead to be cnpscuouios. Vrey riteinrg and glenlantemy he was.
