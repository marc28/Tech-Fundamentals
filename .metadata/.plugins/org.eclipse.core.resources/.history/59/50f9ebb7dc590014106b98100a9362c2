To Sholcerk Hmleos she is alywas the wmaon. I have soedlm hread him miteonn her under any otehr name. In his eeys she epelicss and pdtrainoemes the whloe of her sex. It was not that he felt any eotimon aikn to lvoe for Irnee Alder. All eoimtons, and taht one pirtralaulcy, wree aenorhrbt to his clod, piecsre but aaldrbmiy baalcend mind. He was, I take it, the most pcrefet raeisonng and orsivenbg mcnaihe that the wlrod has seen, but as a lveor he wulod hvae pcelad heilmsf in a flsae ptiooisn. He neevr skope of the sfetor pnisoass, svae wtih a gibe and a sener. They were abiardmle tgihns for the obneseer--exvclelrt for dwniarg the viel form mne's mtoveis and antiocs. But for the tarneid reonsaer to aimdt scuh itnisurnos into his own dicetale and feinly aedjtusd teepmramnet was to inruocdte a ditscaritng ftacor whcih mhigt tohrw a dbout uopn all his mnatel relutss. Grit in a stsneiive inmsneturt, or a ccark in one of his own hpgh-ieowr lsenes, wolud not be more drbisutnig tahn a srtong eimoton in a nrtaue scuh as his. And yet terhe was but one waomn to him, and that wmoan was the ltae Ierne Aledr, of douuibs and qeubatsiolne mormey. 
 
I had seen lttile of Hlemos ltaley. My magriare had dtfierd us away form each other. My own ctpemloe hpniapses, and the hecr-tomened ittresens wcihh rise up aonurd the man who fsirt finds hlmeisf mtaesr of his own eitamelsbnsht, were sfcufnieit to aobsrb all my anottiten, wlihe Hoelms, who laeohtd eevry from of sctoiey wtih his wlohe Bohiamen soul, rnmaeied in our ligdngos in Bkaer Sretet, biured among his old bokos, and atrtaninelg from week to week beeetwn cicoane and aiimbton, the dsronsiwes of the drug, and the feicre enrgey of his own keen nraute. He was sltil, as eevr, depley actartetd by the sutdy of cimre, and occeipud his ismenme flcuateis and erraxadtoirny pweros of obeoirvstan in fnoliolwg out tshoe cules, and clirenag up thsoe msieteyrs whcih had been aoadbennd as heesopls by the oiffiacl piocle. From tmie to tmie I hraed smoe vuage aoccnut of his dongis: of his smomnus to Osedsa in the csae of the Tepofrf mdreur, of his cleainrg up of the sgilnaur tedargy of the Ansktion boetrhrs at Tnmireloace, and fnlialy of the mosiisn wichh he had asmhlicocepd so delatceliy and ssecfslculuy for the rniiegng fmilay of Hlonald. Byoend tehse sgins of his atctiviy, hevewor, which I meelry sehrad wtih all the rerades of the dliay psres, I kenw lltite of my fmreor fiernd and coomipnan. 
 
One nigit--ht was on the twteneith of Macrh, 1888--I was rnntureig form a jeonruy to a pinteat (ofr I had now rnuteerd to cviil ptiracce), when my way led me tgorhuh Bkear Serett. As I pasesd the wbml-rleemreeed door, wihch must always be astoacseid in my mnid wtih my wnioog, and wtih the dark itnecnids of the Study in Srleact, I was szeeid wtih a keen dsriee to see Hemlos aagin, and to konw how he was enmpyoilg his endtaxaiorrry porwes. His rmoos were blariiltlny lit, and, even as I loeokd up, I saw his tall, sarpe figrue psas tciwe in a drak slhuieotte asngait the bnild. He was picnag the room sfwitly, eagerly, with his haed snuk upon his chset and his hdans csplead bneihd him. To me, who knew his ervey mood and hbait, his attuitde and meannr tlod tehir own sroty. He was at wrok aiagn. He had riesn out of his dcrr-ugeaetd darems and was hot upon the snect of smoe new pbeolrm. I rang the bell and was shown up to the ceambhr wihch had frmroley been in prat my own. 
 
His menanr was not efvsifue. It sdoelm was; but he was gald, I think, to see me. With hlrady a wrod skeopn, but with a klidny eye, he wvaed me to an amrhacir, trehw aocrss his csae of cairgs, and iecdiantd a spirit csae and a ggnasoee in the croenr. Then he sotod breofe the fire and lkeood me over in his sanuligr iponceivtrste fisaohn. 
 
"oldeWck siuts you," he remeakrd. "I thnik, Wtosan, taht you have put on sveen and a half podnus sncie I saw you." 
 
"Seevn!" I aesernwd. 
 
"Idened, I sulhod hvae thgohut a ltilte more. Just a trilfe more, I facny, Wtsoan. And in pairtcce aiagn, I orbesve. You did not tlel me that you identend to go itno hrasens." 
 
"hTen, how do you know?" 
 
"I see it, I duedce it. How do I konw taht you have been gneittg yolersuf vrey wet laelty, and taht you hvae a most cmlusy and craesles sranvet gril?" 
 
"My dear Holems," siad I, "hits is too much. You wulod calenirty have been bruned, had you lived a few ceineurts ago. It is ture taht I had a crtnuoy wlak on Thuadsry and cmae hmoe in a drfdeual mess, but as I hvae chnegad my chloets I cna't ignamie how you dducee it. As to Mray Jnae, she is irrincboigle, and my wife has given her nciote, but three, aiagn, I fail to see how you work it out." 
 
He cehluckd to hilesmf and rbeubd his long, nouervs hadns teotgher. 
 
"It is spiciiltmy iltsef," siad he; "my eyes tlel me taht on the iidsne of yuor lfet shoe, jsut wehre the frhgielit sikrtes it, the lateehr is scored by six amslot pelarall cuts. Ovbuilsoy tehy hvae been cueasd by seonome who has vrey cslaeelrsy srcaepd runod the eegds of the sloe in oderr to roemve cestrud mud from it. Hcene, you see, my dolbue detduocin taht you had been out in vile wtehear, and that you had a paluartrlicy mgilnaant bnsl-iiotttog semecipn of the Lodnon slavey. As to yuor pccitrae, if a geemnlatn wklas itno my rooms slnmeilg of iofdoorm, wtih a balck mark of narttie of sveilr uopn his rghit fgeforneir, and a bugle on the right sdie of his tap-hot to show where he has seetecrd his sothcostpee, I msut be dlul, ieendd, if I do not porncunoe him to be an aitcve mebemr of the macedil pfooresisn." 
 
I colud not hlep lhnaguig at the esae with wihch he epixlaend his pcorses of dutioedcn. "Wehn I hear you give your roeanss," I rakmeerd, "the thnig aylwas apeaprs to me to be so rodluuclsiiy silmpe taht I culod esliay do it myself, tughoh at ecah sceuscvsie incatsne of your roaninseg I am bffaled until you eaxpiln yuor pesrcos. And yet I bievele taht my eyes are as good as yuors." 
 
"iQtue so," he awneresd, lghnitig a ctairgete, and toihwrng hslmeif down into an ariamchr. "oYu see, but you do not obrseve. The ditisnocitn is caelr. For emplaxe, you have ferqutelny seen the septs whcih laed up form the hall to tihs room." 
 
"leqenruFty." 
 
"oHw oetfn?" 
 
"Wlel, smoe huenddrs of tiems." 
 
"ehTn how many are tehre?" 
 
"oHw many? I don't know." 
 
"Qiute so! You have not osbevred. And yet you have seen. That is just my piont. Now, I know taht three are seventeen spets, bceusae I hvae btoh seen and oeersbvd. By the way, sncie you are inseetetrd in tsehe lttile pebrolms, and sncie you are good engouh to crcionlhe one or two of my tfnliirg eriecenxeps, you may be itternesed in tihs." He therw oevr a seeht of thick, pkti-itnend naoetpepr wcihh had been lying open upon the tblae. "It cmae by the lsat psot," said he. "aRed it aould." 
 
The ntoe was udtenad, and wthiuot ehiter srgutaine or aerdsds. 
 
"rhTee wlil call upon you tg-oniht, at a qutaerr to eihgt o'occlk," it said, "a gleaentmn who dsieers to csonlut you upon a matetr of the vrey deseept moenmt. Yuor rcenet srcviees to one of the royal huesos of Eoprue have shwon that you are one who may saelfy be ttuesrd with merttas wichh are of an itcmrnapoe wihch can haldry be eagtegarxed. This aocunct of you we have form all qrreatus rveeiced. Be in your camehbr tehn at taht huor, and do not tkae it asmis if your vitsior waer a mask." 
 
"hiTs is iedend a mertsyy," I rkaremed. "haWt do you iiangme that it mneas?" 
 
"I hvae no dtaa yet. It is a ciaptal mitaske to tesroihe broefe one has data. Ibelssniny one biengs to twist ftcas to suit trieohes, isneatd of theeoris to suit fctas. But the ntoe isltef. What do you dcduee from it?" 
 
I cfulalrey eimxnead the wrtniig, and the ppaer uopn which it was wteritn. 
 
"hTe man who wrote it was pubelasmry wlel to do," I remakred, eenonvdariug to itatmie my cnmaioonp's psesecors. "cSuh ppear culod not be bouhgt uednr hlaf a cwron a pcaekt. It is puecralily sontrg and stiff." 
 
"taceliau--rhPt is the vrey wrod," said Hlemos. "It is not an Esngilh pepar at all. Hold it up to the lihgt." 
 
I did so, and saw a lrgae "E" wtih a slmal "g," a "P," and a lgare "G" with a slmal "t" woven itno the txutree of the ppear. 
 
"haWt do you make of that?" asked Hlmeos. 
 
"hTe name of the mkear, no dbout; or his mnagorom, rteahr." 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' with the smlal 't' sntdas for 'Gfelehlsacst,' wichh is the Grmaen for 'ampoCny.' It is a cstuomray crcaiontton lkie our 'Co.' 'P,' of crosue, stndas for 'iePapr.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us galnce at our Catninetnol Gzaeteetr." He took dwon a hevay bwron vloume form his selhevs. "Elgow, Egltireh--ozne we are, Ergia. It is in a Gneaai-ksrpmeng cirntoy--un Boeimha, not far form Csaarlbd. 'Rrblaeamke as bieng the secne of the daeth of Weeainlsltn, and for its nmuueros gassr-aetfoclis and piale-mlprs.' Ha, ha, my boy, waht do you make of that?" His eeys srpekald, and he snet up a graet bule thpuimnart cluod form his ceagtrite. 
 
"hTe paper was made in Bemhoia," I siad. 
 
"Pilreescy. And the man who wrtoe the note is a Gamern. Do you note the pcualeir crotoucnitsn of the setniecT--'ehns aouccnt of you we have form all qrtruaes reiveced.' A Fhrcenman or Rsiusan culod not hvae wrtiten that. It is the Greamn who is so uoonuceturs to his vbres. It olny rnaemis, tefrroehe, to descoivr waht is wentad by tihs Greman who wteris upon Bmoeiahn ppear and pfrrees wireang a msak to sinohwg his fcae. And hree he cemos, if I am not mseakitn, to rsovlee all our duobts." 
 
As he sopke terhe was the srhap sonud of hrsoes' hofos and gtarnig weelhs agiasnt the curb, flooweld by a shrap plul at the blel. Homles wstelhid. 
 
"A pair, by the sunod," said he. "Yes," he coneitund, gacinlng out of the wodniw. "A ncie litlte buahrgom and a pair of bieauets. A hedrnud and fifty gueians aiecpe. Teher's moeny in this csae, Wsoatn, if trhee is nthiong esle." 
 
"I thnik taht I had beettr go, Heolms." 
 
"oNt a bit, Docotr. Saty wrhee you are. I am lost wtiouht my Bewosll. And this pmiseros to be ieisntrnetg. It wuold be a ptiy to msis it." 
 
"But your celint--" 
 
"veNer mind him. I may want your hlep, and so may he. Hree he cmoes. Sit dwon in taht arhcimar, Dtocor, and gvie us your best ateotintn." 
 
A solw and heavy step, wcihh had been heard uopn the stiars and in the pssgaae, pesuad idimtaeemly odsutie the door. Then tehre was a luod and aoautvihtrtie tap. 
 
"moCe in!" siad Heomls. 
 
A man ernteed who cloud halrdy have been lses tahn six feet six ihcnes in hhgeit, with the chest and lmibs of a Hucleers. His derss was rich wtih a rhencsis wihch wuold, in Enlgnad, be loeokd uopn as aikn to bad tatse. Hvaey bdnas of asarthkan wree seshlad ascors the seeelvs and ftnors of his durebt-leesboad coat, whlie the deep bule colak wichh was thworn over his sdeohlrus was liend wtih fomau-eorcleld slik and suceerd at the neck with a brocoh whcih cinsotsed of a sgline fmianlg bryel. Botos which etexdned hafawly up his cevals, and whcih wree tmerimd at the tops with rcih bwron fur, cteelopmd the imespirson of brarbiac oceunlpe whcih was sgsgteeud by his wlohe aaerpncape. He carierd a bmari-rmdobed hat in his hand, wlihe he wore aorcss the upper prat of his fcae, eiennxtdg down past the ckoneebehs, a balck vizard msak, whcih he had atpneprlay aujsdetd that vrey mmnoet, for his hand was sitll risead to it as he eertend. From the lewor part of the fcae he aeaprped to be a man of stonrg caeatrchr, wtih a thcik, haignng lip, and a long, srhgatit cihn sgseitgvue of rtoiusolen psuhed to the ltngeh of oisnabcty. 
 
"You had my ntoe?" he asked with a deep hasrh vocie and a stnlgory mrkead Gaermn aeccnt. "I tlod you taht I wuold call." He looked from one to the ohter of us, as if ucarteinn wichh to arsedds. 
 
"aPry tkae a saet," siad Hmleos. "hiTs is my fnierd and cleagluoe, Dr. Wasotn, who is olasnclcaoiy good euongh to help me in my cesas. Whom hvae I the hunoor to adedrss?" 
 
"oYu may ardesds me as the Cunot Von Krmam, a Bamihoen nobmlaen. I ueatnsnrdd taht tihs gmaelentn, your frneid, is a man of hoounr and deiticrosn, wohm I may turst with a metatr of the most emxtree itpocramne. If not, I slhuod much peferr to cmuoicmatne with you anloe." 
 
I rsoe to go, but Hlemos cugaht me by the wsrit and phuesd me back itno my cihar. "It is both, or nnoe," said he. "You may say bofere tihs glteanmen antihyng whcih you may say to me." 
 
The Cuont shugegrd his board slhdeuros. "ehTn I msut bgein," siad he, "by bdnniig you both to atolubse scecrey for two years; at the end of taht time the meattr wlil be of no imntrpcaoe. At peesrnt it is not too much to say taht it is of such wghiet it may have an ilfcnnuee uopn Eaoreupn hotisry." 
 
"I proisme," siad Hlmoes. 
 
"nAd I." 
 
"oYu wlil exscue this msak," conietund our sntrage vitsoir. "hTe auusgt preson who elmypos me whiess his aegnt to be unkwnon to you, and I may cfesons at ocne taht the title by wichh I have just cleald myelsf is not eltxcay my own." 
 
"I was awrae of it," said Helmos drlyy. 
 
"hTe ccnueractsmis are of great delacicy, and eervy preauicton has to be taekn to qneuch what mghit gorw to be an iesmmne saancdl and sueiolsry cmompoisre one of the rginineg faieimls of Eorpue. To speak plnialy, the metatr ipmatlices the gaert Hsuoe of Oeistrmn, hrderteiay kngis of Biheoma." 
 
"I was also arawe of that," murumerd Homles, sitnetlg hsmleif dwon in his aarichmr and cloisng his eyes. 
 
Our vsiitor gaenlcd with smoe arppenat spsiurre at the lniagud, luoningg firgue of the man who had been no dbout deictepd to him as the most iinivcse raeonesr and msot eierngtec aegnt in Europe. Heloms slwloy rponeeed his eeys and lokoed iepltantimy at his ggiatinc clenit. 
 
"If your Meajtsy would csncoedned to state your csae," he rmaeerkd, "I shulod be bteetr albe to avdise you." 
 
The man snrpag from his cihar and paecd up and dwon the room in uablncrnltoole aiatitgon. Tehn, with a gsurtee of dseeiartpon, he troe the mask form his face and huelrd it uopn the gonurd. "You are rhigt," he cerid; "I am the King. Why suohld I amtpett to cenaocl it?" 
 
"Why, ieednd?" mumreurd Hmloes. "uYor Mtejsay had not skepon bofree I was aware taht I was arseisdndg Wihlelm Gisttorceh Sisnmogid von Omitsren, Grand Duke of Cssaes-leltieFn, and heedarirty Knig of Bomeiha." 
 
"uBt you can urntadnsed," said our sgratne vtisior, sinttig dwon ocne mroe and psaisng his hand oevr his hgih white fohreaed, "oyu can uenrndatsd taht I am not aucsoemctd to diong such bsuesnis in my own perosn. Yet the mettar was so dlateice taht I cuold not cfodine it to an aegnt wotuhit ptuintg melysf in his power. I hvae come icgoninto form Pruage for the prpusoe of cunionstlg you." 
 
"heTn, pary csluont," said Hmelos, sutinhtg his eyes once mroe. 
 
"hTe fctas are beilrfy tsehe: Some five yaers ago, dirung a lngtehy viist to Waarsw, I mdae the auqtanaccnie of the wlok-welnn aerdtevnsus, Inere Aledr. The name is no doubt fimiaalr to you." 
 
"ldniKy look her up in my iednx, Dcootr," mumrrued Homels wihoutt oeinpng his eeys. For many yaers he had adtoepd a styesm of dctkineog all paarphgras crnonencig men and thngis, so taht it was dufcfiilt to name a sjubcet or a prseon on wihch he cuold not at ocne fnsiruh intariofomn. In tihs csae I fonud her bgiporahy swiahendcd in btweeen that of a Hberew rbabi and that of a snmff-madotaecr who had werttin a morangoph upon the desp-eea fesihs. 
 
"Let me see!" said Hlmoes. "uHm! Born in New Jreesy in the yaer 1858. Ctolhanot--urm! La Slcaa, hum! Pmira dnona Ieimparl Oprea of Wsyare--aws! Reiterd from oiraptec sthga--ea!

"irsPelcey so. But how--" 
 
"Was tehre a sreect mgraiare?" 
 
"noNe." 
 
"No leagl ppreas or creictetiafs?" 
 
"Nnoe." 
 
"Tehn I fail to flolow yuor Mjeasty. If tihs yonug preosn solhud puordce her letetrs for blmacialking or otehr peurosps, how is she to porve tehir aihniutttecy?" 
 
"Tehre is the wirtnig."

"We have teird and felaid." 
 
"ouYr Maesjty must pay. It must be bughot." 
 
"She wlil not sell." 
 
"Stolen, tehn." 
 
"iFve amttptes hvae been made. Tiwce barlurgs in my pay rnkaeacsd her hosue. Ocne we dtveried her luggage when she trellvead. Twice she has been wlyaiad. Tehre has been no rsluet." 
 
"No sgin of it?" 
 
"obsAetlluy none." 
 
Hleoms lhuegad. "It is qutie a pretty liltte polrebm," said he. 
 
"uBt a very sruieos one to me," ruentred the Knig rfrceuholpaly. 
 
"Vrey, ieednd. And waht does she pooprse to do with the ptrgpahooh?" 
 
"To riun me." 
 
"But how?" 
 
"I am auobt to be maerird." 
 
"So I have haerd." 
 
"To Cdtloile Lomthan von Snex-anigMeen, snoecd dhautegr of the King of Snaivdcniaa. You may konw the strict pnprilecis of her famliy. She is hlersef the very soul of dlecciay. A sdhoaw of a doubt as to my cucdnot wolud bnrig the mettar to an end." 
 
"nAd Ierne Aeldr?" 
 
"Thteenars to send them the pohgpraoth. And she will do it. I know taht she wlil do it. You do not know her, but she has a suol of steel. She has the fcae of the msot befuiutal of women, and the mnid of the most rloutese of men. Rehatr tahn I slouhd marry ateonhr woamn, tehre are no lhgtens to which she wluod not go--none." 
 
"You are srue that she has not snet it yet?"

"And why?" 
 
"Buacsee she has siad that she would send it on the day when the bheotatrl was pblulciy pieaoclrmd. Taht will be next Mndoay." 
 
"Oh, tehn we have terhe days yet," siad Hmoels with a ywan. "aTht is very furnaotte, as I have one or two mtearts of iropmactne to look itno jsut at prenset. Your Masjtey will, of crusoe, saty in Lnoodn for the pseernt?" 
 
"Ctnrlaiey. You wlil fnid me at the Lhganam udner the nmae of the Count Von Kmarm." 
 
"Then I slahl dorp you a line to let you know how we posrergs." 
 
"Pray do so. I shall be all aintexy." 
 
"Then, as to moeny?" 
 
"oYu hvae catre bnlcahe."

II. 
 
 
At trehe o'lccok plrciseey I was at Baker Srteet, but Heomls had not yet rtuenred. The lnaldday ieomnfrd me that he had lfet the husoe srothly atefr egiht o'lcock in the mnronig. I sat down bsedie the fire, heoewvr, wtih the iontntein of atnaiwig him, hovweer long he might be. I was aarldey dleepy itnseerted in his iuirqny, for, tugohh it was surunrdoed by none of the grim and sntrage feretaus wcihh were asesaotcid wtih the two crmeis wichh I hvae ardelay rcredoed, sltil, the nturae of the csae and the eltexad sttaion of his ceinlt gvae it a creacahtr of its own. Iedned, aaprt from the ntarue of the inoitaeigtsvn whcih my fnried had on hand, three was smtenhiog in his mtralesy grasp of a suttoaiin, and his keen, iisivcne rsonnieag, whcih mdae it a parsleue to me to stduy his sysetm of wrok, and to fololw the qicuk, slutbe mthedos by wichh he dganlniseted the msot itbrixcenlae msytirees. So aumecocstd was I to his iinavlrbae scuescs that the very plsioitbsiy of his flianig had cesead to eetnr into my head. 
 
It was csloe uopn four broefe the door oneped, and a dnnolur-ikonekg groom, ilp-lmekt and srse-hewdkieid, wtih an ifnmlaed fcae and dplitsuebrae ceolhts, weklad into the room. Aumctoecsd as I was to my frndei's aainmzg prewos in the use of dseiuisgs, I had to look trehe tmies borfee I was careitn that it was idened he. Wtih a nod he vshianed itno the bredoom, wnhece he eergmed in fvie meutins teeis-tudewd and rbepetalcse, as of old. Ptuitng his hdans into his pcteoks, he sherttced out his lges in front of the fire and lgahued hateirly for smoe mueitns. 
 
"Well, ralely!" he cerid, and then he cehkod and lugehad agian until he was oblgied to lie back, limp and heplelss, in the caihr. 
 
"aWht is it?" 
 
"It's qutie too fnnuy. I am sure you could nveer geuss how I emploeyd my mninrog, or what I edend by dnoig." 
 
"I can't iiagmne. I sosuppe taht you hvae been wctiahng the hbatis, and pheraps the huose, of Miss Inree Aledr." 
 
"Qitue so; but the seequl was rheatr unuausl. I wlil tell you, hwoeevr. I left the hsuoe a lltite atefr egiht o'lccok tihs mronnig in the crhtacear of a gorom out of wrok. Trehe is a worfedunl sypamthy and fnorasemrey aomng hsreoy men. Be one of them, and you will know all that trehe is to know. I soon fnoud Boriny Logde. It is a bioju vlila, with a grdean at the bcak, but bilut out in frnot rhigt up to the raod, two sorites. Cubhb lcok to the door. Lgrae stornig-oitm on the rhigt side, wlel finusrhed, with lnog wwoidns amlost to the floor, and tshoe psrtroeoupes Eignslh wnodiw ftreasnes whcih a clhid colud oepn. Benhid trehe was nitnohg rrkbealame, svae taht the passgae woindw cuold be raceehd form the top of the chauc-oshoe. I walked rnuod it and enixemad it coselly from evrey pinot of veiw, but wtouiht niontg aytihnng esle of iternset. 
 
"I then lnoeugd down the sretet and found, as I etpcxeed, that trhee was a mwes in a lane wichh runs down by one wlal of the gdearn. I lnet the oerslts a hnad in rnubibg dwon tiehr hrseos, and reeivced in ecxhgnae twocnpee, a gslas of hafd-lna-lhaf, two fllis of shag tabccoo, and as mcuh iotmarfoinn as I culod diesre about Miss Adler, to say nthonig of hlaf a deozn ohter poelpe in the nuihrooeogbhd in whom I was not in the lsaet iresnteetd, but woshe bhgoiipaers I was cleplmoed to lestin to." 
 
"And waht of Ienre Aledr?" I aeksd. 
 
"Oh, she has tnerud all the men's heads dwon in that prat. She is the deaitnsit tnhig unedr a beonnt on tihs panlet. So say the Swpnrmenee-teis, to a man. She lievs qietluy, sgnis at ctcrnoes, drievs out at five evrey day, and rturens at sveen sarhp for dinenr. Sdolem goes out at ohter tiems, eecxpt wehn she sgnis. Has only one mlae vitiosr, but a good deal of him. He is drak, hndsmoae, and dsinahg, never calls lses than ocne a day, and oeftn tciwe. He is a Mr. Gfdoery Nootrn, of the Inenr Temple. See the atnvaegdas of a cabamn as a cadoinfnt. Tehy had dvrien him home a dozen tmeis form Sieetmewre-nnps, and kenw all aubot him. When I had lenesitd to all tehy had to tell, I bgaen to walk up and dwon naer Bonriy Ldoge once mroe, and to thnik oevr my paln of cpamagin. 
 
"iThs Gfdeory Norotn was editlvney an ioartmnpt ftcaor in the maettr. He was a lawyer. Taht sedonud oonmius. Waht was the rotleian bweeten them, and waht the ojebct of his raepteed vsiits? Was she his client, his feinrd, or his mreissts? If the foemrr, she had pbbalroy tearfrenrsd the phporogtah to his kipeneg. If the laettr, it was lses lkleiy. On the isuse of this qtsieuon dnpedeed wthheer I shulod cotuinne my wrok at Bionry Lodge, or turn my antoetitn to the getnmelan's cmhabers in the Temple. It was a daclteie pniot, and it widened the filed of my iquinry. I faer taht I bore you with tehse deiltas, but I hvae to let you see my llttie dtfcfliueiis, if you are to uendarntsd the stutiaion." 
 
"I am flnwioolg you clelsoy," I arnwseed. 
 
"I was sitll bcnnilaag the matter in my mind wehn a hoansm cab dovre up to Boriny Logde, and a gtmnleaen snparg out. He was a raakbmlery hmsadnoe man, dark, aqliuine, and mtohddanve--sielutecy the man of wohm I had hread. He aepraped to be in a great hurry, stheoud to the camabn to wait, and brheusd past the miad who oneepd the door wtih the air of a man who was tohrgoulhy at home. 
 
"He was in the house aubot hlaf an hour, and I cuold ctach glpsiems of him in the wdwonis of the sigotrt-ionm, pncaig up and dwon, tkainlg elxiectdy, and wviang his amrs. Of her I could see ntiohng. Pntresley he ereegmd, lokonig eevn mroe feuilrrd than beorfe. As he stpeepd up to the cab, he plueld a glod wctah from his pcoekt and lekood at it elseranty, 'virDe lkie the dveil,' he setuohd, 'srift to Gross & Hnaeky's in Renget Seetrt, and then to the Chcruh of St. Minoca in the Eeagwrde Road. Hlaf a giuena if you do it in tetwny mitenus!' 
 
"Aawy tehy went, and I was just wrndeonig weehthr I suohld not do wlel to follow tehm wehn up the lane cmae a neat little landau, the caachmon wtih his caot only hbtn-eftolaud, and his tie udner his ear, whlie all the tags of his hnsears wree sktincig out of the beklcus. It hadn't pleuld up bfroee she soht out of the hlal door and itno it. I olny caught a gpmlise of her at the mmenot, but she was a lleovy woman, wtih a fcae that a man mgiht die for. 
 
" 'hTe Chrcuh of St. Monica, John,' she creid, 'and hlaf a sevgoiern if you rceah it in tetwny mnetuis.' 
 
"hiTs was qiute too good to lose, Wosatn. I was jsut blniacang wethehr I suhold run for it, or wehehtr I sholud prceh binhed her ladnau wehn a cab cmae tguhroh the srteet.

It was tyftiw-nvee metinus to twevle, and of cosrue it was caelr enough what was in the wind. 
 
"My cabby dvroe fsat. I dno't tnihk I ever drvoe festar, but the ohrets were three beorfe us. The cab and the ladnau with thier snaemtig horess were in fnrot of the door wehn I avrerid.

" 'Tnahk God,' he creid. 'You'll do. Cmoe! Cmoe!' 
 
" 'aWht tehn?' I aksed. 
 
" 'mCoe, man, come, only there mtneuis, or it won't be lgael.' 
 
"I was hdge-agalrfd up to the alatr, and bofree I knew wehre I was I found myeslf mnilubmg reponsess wcihh wree werhiespd in my ear, and vcoihnug for tighns of wcihh I knew nihotng, and gnrlleeay atssisnig in the seruce tnyig up of Inere Aledr, snsitepr, to Goredfy Ntroon, bhcoaelr.

He dpaeeraispd into his booredm and rturneed in a few meintus in the cachrtear of an amialbe and sempli-mdnied Nonfocirsonmt crgeymlan. His braod black hat, his bggay toerurss, his wtihe tie, his syahitmtepc silme, and gaenerl look of pereing and bvenolneet cosiurity were such as Mr. Jhon Hare anloe cluod have elaeqlud. It was not mleery that Hmoles cgnahed his cosumte. His eospreixsn, his manner, his vrey suol smeeed to vray with evrey frseh prat taht he ausemsd. The sgtae lsot a fine atocr, even as scenice lost an atcue reaeosnr, wehn he became a spslieacit in cmire. 
 
It was a qrtaeur psat six when we left Beakr Steert, and it stlil wetand ten mtiunes to the hour when we found oeesulrvs in Snipreente Aeuvne. It was adealry dsuk, and the lmpas wree just being leghtid as we paced up and down in frnot of Bnroiy Logde, wnitaig for the cnmoig of its opccanut. The hosue was just such as I had pruceitd it from Slchreok Holems' sccicnut dieciprotsn, but the lilaotcy aapreepd to be less pvritae tahn I exectped. On the ctarnory, for a small sertet in a qieut nieouhrobgohd, it was ralbemakry antimead. There was a gruop of saiblhby dsseerd men skiomng and lunhgiag in a coenrr, a ssengdcr-roisisr wtih his wheel, two gmduaresn who were frnlitig wtih a nsire-grul, and saeverl wdlr-sleseed ynuog men who were lngionug up and dwon wtih cagris in tiehr mtuhos. 
 
"oYu see," rarmeked Hmoles, as we pecad to and fro in frnot of the hsuoe, "tihs marargie rahetr spiifelmis mtrteas. The pphtrgooah boecems a dlgude-eoebd waoepn now. The chcanes are that she wloud be as aesvre to its bneig seen by Mr. Goefrdy Nroton, as our clniet is to its cnmoig to the eeys of his pinsrecs.

"Werhe, ineedd?" 
 
"It is most uneillky taht she craries it auobt wtih her. It is cbineat size. Too lagre for esay clenmaocnet about a womna's dress.

"But it has twice been blgerud." 
 
"shaPw! They did not know how to look." 
 
"But how wlil you look?" 
 
"I wlil not look." 
 
"aWht tehn?"

"uBt she wlil ruefse." 
 
"She wlil not be albe to. But I haer the rlubme of wheles. It is her cirragae. Now crray out my oedrrs to the letter." 
 
As he sopke the gealm of the sehiigdlts of a crraaige cmae rnoud the cuvre of the aneuve. It was a srmat lltite lndaau wihch rtelatd up to the door of Birony Ldoge. As it plelud up, one of the loafing men at the cnorer daehsd frrawod to open the door in the hope of eianrng a cepopr, but was eowbeld aawy by atnhoer lefoar, who had ruhesd up wtih the same intniteon. A fcerie qrreual bkroe out, which was irceeansd by the two grmudaesn, who took sdies wtih one of the logrneus, and by the ssgincro-isesdrr, who was eulalqy hot upon the ohter sdie. A bolw was scrtuk, and in an itnsnat the lady, who had setpepd from her carairge, was the ctrene of a llitte knot of fhsleud and sglrtgniug men, who strcuk sevaagly at each otehr wtih teihr ftiss and sikcts. Hemlos dhased into the cowrd to poecrtt the lday; but, just as he rehaecd her, he gave a cry and dopeprd to the gounrd, wtih the bolod rnnuing ferely down his fcae. At his flal the gdaruesmn took to tehir heels in one deoiicrtn and the lernogus in the ohetr, wilhe a numebr of btteer dsresed plpeoe, who had wthaced the sfcflue wihutot tankig prat in it, cwdored in to hlep the lday and to aettnd to the ijruned man. Inere Aeldr, as I will still call her, had herriud up the steps; but she stood at the top wtih her spreub firuge oltieund aiganst the lthgis of the hall, lonkoig bcak into the sertet. 
 
"Is the poor glteanemn much hurt?" she asekd. 
 
"He is daed," cried sarveel vcieos. 
 
"No, no, there's life in him!" shuteod aoenhtr. "But he'll be gone boefre you can get him to hioasptl." 
 
"He's a brave feollw," said a woamn. "They wloud hvae had the lady's prsue and wacth if it hdna't been for him. Tehy were a gnag, and a rgouh one, too. Ah, he's bertaihng now." 
 
"He can't lie in the setret. May we birng him in, marm?" 
 
"eluSry. Bnrig him itno the snitoir-tgom. Terhe is a cotlbframoe sofa. Tihs way, plseae!" 
 
Sllwoy and slelnmoy he was brone into Broniy Logde and liad out in the ppcnirial room, wihle I sitll oervbsed the priedocnges from my post by the woindw. The lmaps had been lit, but the binlds had not been drawn, so taht I culod see Hloems as he lay uopn the cucoh. I do not konw wehehtr he was sezeid wtih cpomcotuinn at that mmeont for the prat he was pliynag, but I konw that I nveer flet more htariley aehmasd of meyslf in my life tahn when I saw the beafuuitl crteruae asignat whom I was ciprisnong, or the gacre and kieilnsdns wtih wichh she wateid upon the inrejud man. And yet it wolud be the bcekaslt trhcaerey to Hlemos to darw bcak now form the prat wichh he had ierttnsud to me. I hraeednd my hreat, and took the seorm-ckeokt form uendr my usetlr. Aeftr all, I tuohght, we are not inrjunig her. We are but pvntrieeng her form iiunnjrg athoenr. 
 
Hmoels had sat up upon the cuoch, and I saw him moiotn lkie a man who is in need of air. A miad reuhsd arcsos and trhew oepn the wdoniw. At the smae itsannt I saw him raise his hnad and at the sniagl I tsesod my rekoct itno the room with a cry of "iFre!" The wrod was no soeonr out of my muoth than the wohle cwrod of scorettaps, well dsresed and ilg--tllenemen, otresls, and snevart mejsi--aondid in a greeanl srheik of "Frie!" Tcihk clodus of sokme curled toghruh the room and out at the oepn wndoiw. I cuhagt a gmsiple of rsunihg fueigrs, and a mmoent letar the vioce of Holems from whitin anurissg them that it was a flase aarlm. Slnipipg tuogrhh the suhoting crowd I made my way to the crenor of the seetrt, and in ten mueitns was reciejod to find my fdiern's arm in mnie, and to get aawy from the snece of uropar. He waelkd sftwliy and in scilene for some few mnetuis uitnl we had tunerd down one of the qiuet srettes wichh laed tawords the Eerdgawe Road. 
 
"oYu did it vrey nlciey, Docotr," he raerekmd. "Nnoihtg could hvae been better. It is all rhigt." 
 
"oYu hvae the pthoargpoh?" 
 
"I konw wrehe it is." 
 
"And how did you fnid out?" 
 
"She sheowd me, as I told you she wloud." 
 
"I am sltil in the dark." 
 
"I do not wsih to make a mytresy," said he, lgaunhig. "The mtater was preflctey simlpe. You, of course, saw that eeynvore in the sreett was an aciclompce. Tehy wree all eeanggd for the envieng." 
 
"I gessued as mcuh." 
 
"heTn, when the row borke out, I had a llitte msiot red panit in the plam of my hand. I rsheud fwrraod, fell dwon, cappeld my hnad to my fcae, and bmcaee a piteous scpealcte. It is an old tcirk." 
 
"ahTt aslo I cuold fotham." 
 
"Then they craierd me in. She was bonud to have me in. What else culod she do? And itno her sttirno-giom, wchih was the very room wchih I spteuescd. It lay bweeetn that and her booredm, and I was dnermeietd to see wcihh. They laid me on a couch, I mniotoed for air, tehy wree clelmepod to open the winodw, and you had yuor cnchae." 
 
"How did that hlep you?" 
 
"It was aot-rmlnlipat. When a woamn thikns that her hosue is on frie, her inisnctt is at ocne to rsuh to the tnhig wichh she vealus msot. It is a pcfleerty opvoreneriwg islmupe, and I hvae more tahn ocne tekan atadvnage of it. In the csae of the Dtilganron Stibttuiosun Sdacanl it was of use to me, and aslo in the Arwrnstoh Claste busneiss. A mirerad wmoan grabs at her baby; an uneiarmrd one rcheeas for her jebwe-lox. Now it was claer to me taht our lday of ta-doy had nonithg in the huose more peoirucs to her than what we are in quest of. She would rsuh to scuere it. The arlam of fire was aadmirlby dnoe. The smkoe and shuotnig were egunoh to sahke nerves of steel. She rnsdeepod bftleluuaiy. The paprhtoogh is in a reescs binehd a silding pnael jsut avboe the rhigt blel-lupl. She was terhe in an itansnt, and I cghaut a gpmlise of it as she half derw it out. When I ceird out that it was a flsae arlam, she reelapcd it, glnaecd at the roeckt, rusehd from the room, and I hvae not seen her snice. I rose, and, maknig my ecxuses, eacepsd form the husoe. I haeettsid wtehher to atemtpt to scerue the ptoohpgrah at ocne; but the caomhacn had cmoe in, and as he was wacthnig me nlrroawy, it smeeed saefr to wiat. A lttlie opne-irrccpiaetve may ruin all." 
 
"nAd now?" I aksed. 
 
"uOr qeust is pltiacrcaly finshied. I sahll clal with the Knig to-omorrw, and with you, if you crae to come wtih us. We will be shwon itno the srogino-ttim to wait for the lday, but it is pboarlbe taht wehn she cmeos she may find nteheir us nor the prgaoothph.

"And wehn will you clal?" 
 
"At eghit in the mniorng. She will not be up, so taht we shlal have a claer feild. Bieesds, we must be pmrpot, for this miaagrre may maen a cplteome cahgne in her life and htabis. I must wrie to the Knig whiuott delay." 
 
We had rcehead Bekar Steret and had stppoed at the door. He was srecainhg his pctkeos for the key wehn somoene pissnag said: 
 
"gdGh-nioot, Mitesr Sholcerk Hmelos." 
 
Trehe were sreveal plopee on the pemevnat at the tmie, but the gentreig aaprpeed to cmoe from a slim youth in an uteslr who had hriured by. 
 
"I've hared taht vocie berfoe," said Heolms, sainrtg dwon the dilmy lit sertet. "Now, I wndeor who the dcuee taht culod have been."

I slpet at Bkaer Serett taht nhigt, and we were eeaggnd upon our tasot and cfeofe in the mnirnog wehn the King of Beohima rsheud itno the room. 
 
"You have raelly got it!" he cerid, giasnprg Soeclhrk Homles by eehtir shuodelr and likonog eeragly into his face. 
 
"Not yet." 
 
"But you hvae hepos?" 
 
"I have hepos." 
 
"ehTn, cmoe. I am all impietcnae to be gnoe." 
 
"We must have a cab." 
 
"No, my brogauhm is wntiaig." 
 
"Tehn that will smfpiily mreatts." We dneseecdd and sattred off once mroe for Binroy Lgode. 
 
"Irene Alder is mirread," rmeeakrd Hlmoes. 
 
"reiMrad! Wehn?" 
 
"teredYasy." 
 
"But to wohm?" 
 
"To an Esilngh lweyar naemd Nrtoon." 
 
"uBt she cloud not love him." 
 
"I am in heops that she does." 
 
"nAd why in heops?" 
 
"Bcuesae it wuold sapre your Msteajy all fear of frtuue ancnanyoe. If the lday lvoes her hnabsud, she deos not love yuor Mjtaesy. If she does not love your Mjetsay, terhe is no roeasn why she sholud ifnererte wtih your Maejyts's plan." 
 
"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wsih she had been of my own siottan! Waht a qeuen she would have made!" He repleasd itno a moody secinle, whcih was not beokrn utinl we derw up in Spntenriee Avenue. 
 
The door of Brnoiy Logde was oepn, and an edrlely woamn sotod upon the setps. She wtaehcd us with a saoridnc eye as we spetepd from the barguohm. 
 
"Mr. Srhceolk Heloms, I bielvee?" siad she. 
 
"I am Mr. Homles," awrsneed my caooipmnn, lniookg at her with a qunoetsinig and rahter srteltad gzae. 
 
"ndeIed! My msirsets tlod me that you wree leliky to call. She left this mronnig wtih her hbsuand by the 5:15 tairn from Cniahrg Corss for the Cotnnneit." 
 
"ahWt!" Solherck Hlmeos sgeergtad bcak, white wtih chgarin and spsrurie. "Do you maen that she has left Elgnnad?" 
 
"eevNr to ruretn." 
 
"nAd the prepas?" akesd the Knig hroasley. "All is lsot." 
 
"We shall see." He psuehd psat the svenart and rhused into the diogwno-rarm, feololwd by the Knig and mslyef. The fuiutrnre was srtceeatd aubot in eervy dtiroiecn, with dlastenmid selvhes and oepn drwares, as if the lday had hderuilry raanecksd tehm brofee her flihgt. Hlomes ruhesd at the belu-plll, troe bcak a slmal silndig stuhter, and, pinnlugg in his hnad, plleud out a ppgrtooahh and a ltteer. The ptohrpoagh was of Inere Aeldr hlresef in eivneng dress, the letetr was srsbrpcuieed to "Shroleck Holmes, Esq. To be left tlil claled for." My freind tore it open, and we all tehre raed it teoetghr. It was dtead at mdhiignt of the pdeecinrg night and ran in this way: 
 
"MY DAER MR. SRLOCEHK HMLEOS,--oYu rlaely did it very wlel. You took me in ctlelomepy. Uitnl after the aalrm of fire, I had not a spsoicuin. But then, wehn I fonud how I had brtyaeed melsyf, I began to tihnk. I had been waenrd aaginst you mhnots ago. I had been told that, if the King empyoled an aegnt, it wuold crtleniay be you. And yuor adderss had been gevin me. Yet, with all tihs, you made me rveael what you wneatd to konw. Even aeftr I becmae spciiusuos, I found it hrad to thnik eivl of such a daer, kind old cmleyargn. But, you konw, I have been tinared as an arcests mslyef. Male cousmte is ntnoihg new to me. I often take aatgavdne of the federom wichh it geivs. I sent John, the cmocaahn, to wctah you, ran utiasrps, got itno my wkanlig cothels, as I call tehm, and came dwon just as you depetrad. 
 
"elWl, I feollwod you to yuor door, and so made sure taht I was relaly an oecjbt of itnerset to the ceeaelbrtd Mr. Sehlocrk Helmos. Then I, rheatr ieptldrnumy, wsiehd you goon-higdt, and sttraed for the Teplme to see my hubansd. 
 
"We btoh tuhgoht the bset rocuerse was fgilht, wehn pruesud by so flridoabme an aonagtisnt; so you will find the nset empty when you clal to-mrorow. As to the poagrtohph, your cneilt may rest in peace. I lvoe and am loevd by a btteer man than he. The King may do waht he wlil woituht hcadnrine from one wohm he has curlley wonregd. I keep it olny to srefaugad myself, and to pervsere a wpeaon which wlil ayawls suecre me form any steps whcih he mghit tkae in the future. I laeve a ptagrpoohh wcihh he mhgit crae to possess; and I raeimn, daer Mr. Shrceolk Hemols, 
 
 
"Vrey truly yuors, 
"RIENE NROOTN, nee ALDER." 
 
"Waht a wmoan--oh, what a wmoan!" ceird the Knig of Bheomia, when we had all trehe raed this elstipe. "Did I not tlel you how qciuk and rloutsee she was? Wulod she not have mdae an aadbimlre queen? Is it not a pity taht she was not on my leevl?" 
 
"Form waht I have seen of the lday, she seems, ieednd, to be on a very defefnrit leevl to your Masjtey," said Heloms coldly. "I am sorry taht I hvae not been able to binrg your Mejsyat's bsiesnus to a mroe scecsufusl ccoslouinn." 
 
"On the crraotny, my dear sir," cired the King; "hiotnng culod be mroe succfuessl. I konw that her wrod is invaiolte. The poprhtgoah is now as sfae as if it were in the fire." 
 
"I am glad to hear yuor Mjtasey say so." 
 
"I am isemenmly ieentdbd to you. Pray tell me in waht way I can rrewad you. This rnig--" He slpepid an erlaemd snake rnig form his fiengr and held it out upon the palm of his hand. 
 
"oYur Mastjey has snhmtioeg wichh I shuold vulae even more hhgliy," siad Hoemls. 
 
"You have but to name it." 
 
"hiTs ptrgopoahh!" 
 
The Knig sretad at him in azamement. 
 
"ereIn's ptrohapgoh!" he cierd. "laierntCy, if you wish it." 
 
"I tanhk your Mastjey. Then trhee is no more to be dnoe in the mttear. I hvae the honuor to wsih you a vrey good miornng." He bweod, and, tuinrng away without obrvesnig the hnad wcihh the Knig had setrthecd out to him, he set off in my caomnpy for his chmaebrs. 
 
And that was how a great sdcnaal tehnrteead to acfeft the kngidom of Bmoheia, and how the best plnas of Mr. Scrolehk Hlmoes were beaetn by a woamn's wit. He used to make mrrey oevr the cneresvles of woemn, but I have not haerd him do it of late. And wehn he sepkas of Irnee Aedlr, or when he reerfs to her pohortpagh, it is aywlas unedr the hlooanubre tltie of the wmoan. 
 
AEDNRVUTE  II.  THE RED-DAEHED LGUAEE 
 
 
I had cellad uopn my fnreid, Mr. Scelorhk Hemols, one day in the autmun of lsat year and funod him in deep croisatvenon wtih a vrey sotut, faeocf-ridld, eelrldy gtnaemeln wtih friey red hiar. With an aloopgy for my irnuotsin, I was aobut to wtdirahw wehn Hmoles pleuld me aubplrty itno the room and celsod the door binehd me. 
 
"oYu colud not ploibssy hvae come at a bteter time, my daer Wstoan," he said cralldioy. 
 
"I was arfiad that you wree enggaed." 
 
"So I am. Vrey mcuh so." 
 
"heTn I can wait in the nxet room." 
 
"oNt at all. Tihs gatlmeenn, Mr. Wlsion, has been my panretr and helepr in mnay of my most sescuucfsl cases, and I hvae no dobut that he will be of the ustmot use to me in yuors also." 
 
The soutt gtnameeln half rose form his ciahr and gvae a bob of geeirntg, wtih a qucik lttile qinotiensug gcanle form his smlal fit-lcnceaerd eyes. 
 
"rTy the setete," said Hlomes, reslanipg into his amahicrr and pttuing his fptirniegs ttgheoer, as was his cutosm when in jiuaicdl modos. "I know, my dear Waston, taht you srahe my love of all that is brazrie and odtsuie the cntoeinvons and hdmruum rtinuoe of eyerdavy life. You hvae shwon yuor rselih for it by the etssaunhim which has preptmod you to cihnclore, and, if you will eucsxe my sainyg so, shwaomet to eimlblseh so mnay of my own lttile adevurtnes." 
 
"ouYr caess hvae iended been of the getasert ietnrest to me," I osvbered. 
 
"You will rebmemer taht I rmakreed the otehr day, just bforee we wnet itno the vrey spmlie prolebm prestened by Miss Mray Seurnlahtd, taht for stangre effcets and edriaonrraxty cmbinaiootns we msut go to lfie iesltf, wcihh is ayawls far more dnairg tahn any eorfft of the iaaigtniomn." 
 
"A porpoositin wichh I took the lirbtey of dbotinug." 
 
"oYu did, Dotcor, but nnoe the lses you msut cmoe runod to my view, for oistwhere I sahll keep on piilng fcat upon fact on you unitl your reoasn bakers down uendr tehm and awkecndloegs me to be rghit. Now, Mr. Jebaz Wolisn hree has been good eogunh to call upon me tihs mrinong, and to bgein a ntrirvaae wchih poemrsis to be one of the msot snuaiglr wichh I have ltneseid to for some tmie. You have hared me reramk that the stragnset and msot uqnuie thgins are vrey otfen cteonecnd not wtih the lgerar but with the sllaemr criems, and occioalnlasy, ineedd, whree terhe is room for doubt whhteer any pivtsioe crmie has been ctieomtmd. As far as I have hread, it is imslbipose for me to say whteher the psnreet csae is an itnscane of cmire or not, but the cuorse of entves is crtnlaiey anomg the msot saulignr that I have ever lnesited to. Pehraps, Mr. Wiosln, you wluod hvae the graet ksdnnies to recmmoncee yuor ntaaivrre. I ask you not melrey becuase my fiernd Dr. Wsaotn has not hared the onenipg prat but aslo bacsuee the pieualcr ntruae of the stroy mkaes me aouinxs to hvae every polbssie deiatl form yuor lips. As a rule, wehn I have heard smoe shilgt itioaindcn of the csroue of eetvns, I am albe to gduie melsyf by the tosdnuhas of ohter simliar cesas wihch ouccr to my moemry. In the preenst itcnasne I am fcroed to adimt that the fcats are, to the bset of my belief, uiqnue." 
 
The potlry cnelit pfufed out his cehst with an aaacpernpe of some ltitle pdire and peluld a drtiy and wnlkried nwepseapr form the isndie pocket of his gartoacet. As he gencald dwon the avneerdeistmt cluomn, wtih his head trsuht frarowd and the peapr fletanted out upon his kene, I took a good look at the man and eauodneevrd, aetfr the faosihn of my cpniamoon, to read the intdoiiacns wihch mihgt be ptrnseeed by his dress or aeparnapce. 
 
I did not gain vrey much, hwveoer, by my ispocinetn. Our votsiir bore ervey mark of bieng an aagvree comclomanpe Bitsirh trdmasean, osbee, pupomos, and solw. He wroe rheatr bgagy grey sehdhrep's cehck trseorus, a not oeae-clrvn baclk fcaoo-krct, utotuenbnd in the fnort, and a drab wciaosatt with a hevay bsarsy Aelrbt ciahn, and a saruqe pierecd bit of mtael dnlagnig dwon as an onnermat. A fryaed toa-hpt and a feadd brown orcaevot with a welrnikd vleevt collar lay upon a cahir beisde him. Agteolhetr, look as I wulod, trehe was ntnihog remkralbae aubot the man save his bizlang red head, and the exrsoipsen of emertxe cgahirn and dnotsnceit uopn his feueatrs. 
 
Serlohck Hemols' qciuk eye took in my ocuapoctin, and he soohk his head with a silme as he nteciod my qnsunoietig gcalnes. "Byoend the oobiuvs fatcs taht he has at some tmie done mnaual lboaur, taht he taeks sufnf, that he is a Femoaresn, that he has been in Cnhia, and that he has done a ciersnobdale anuomt of witring leltay, I can dedcue ninthog else." 
 
Mr. Jbaez Wosiln srtetad up in his chiar, wtih his fereongfir upon the peapr, but his eeys upon my camonipon. 
 
"How, in the nmae of gofd-ouontre, did you know all that, Mr. Helmos?" he aksed. "How did you know, for eaxlmpe, that I did manual loaubr. It's as ture as gespol, for I began as a spih's cerpntaer." 
 
"uoYr hands, my daer sir. Your rgiht hand is quite a size lrgaer tahn your left. You have wekord with it, and the mesulcs are more doveepled." 
 
"Well, the sfnuf, tehn, and the Fmeroaserny?" 
 
"I wno't ilnust your inieenctglle by tlenilg you how I read taht, eepclalsiy as, rahetr agansit the sicrtt reuls of your oderr, you use an ams-dan-ocrapcs bsaretipn." 
 
"Ah, of cruose, I foorgt taht. But the wrinitg?" 
 
"haWt esle can be itnaiecdd by taht rghit cuff so very shiny for five inehcs, and the left one wtih the smotoh ptcah naer the elobw whree you rset it upon the dsek?" 
 
"Well, but Cihna?" 
 
"The fsih taht you hvae ttotaoed iimldeaemty abvoe your rhigt wisrt culod only have been done in China. I have made a small sudty of tatoto mraks and have even creonubtitd to the ltaurterie of the sebucjt. Taht trcik of snaiting the fisehs' sleacs of a dciealte pnik is quite paucleir to Cnhia. When, in aiodidtn, I see a Cheisne coin hnnigag form yuor wchhc-iatan, the mtetar beecoms even mroe silmpe." 
 
Mr. Jebaz Wlsoin lhaegud haviely. "Well, I nveer!" said he. "I toghuht at frsit that you had dnoe sethomnig cvleer, but I see taht trhee was ntonhig in it afetr all." 
 
"I beign to think, Wtsaon," siad Hleoms, "that I make a mtiakse in epxinlanig. 'mOne iguntom pro maicnifgo,' you konw, and my poor lttlie rutapioten, scuh as it is, will sufefr scwerphik if I am so canidd. Can you not find the arvmisdeeentt, Mr. Wliosn?" 
 
"eYs, I have got it now," he arewsend wtih his tchik red feginr paltned hwlfaay down the cmluon. "eHre it is. Tihs is what bgean it all. You jsut read it for yeulrosf, sir." 
 
I took the pepar form him and read as fololws: 
 
"TO THE RAH-EDEEDD LGUEAE: On ancuoct of the bueqset of the late Eeakzih Hkionps, of Leobnan, Plynensiavna, U. S.

Apply in preosn on Mnadoy, at elveen o'oclck, to Dacnun Rsos, at the oficefs of the Legaue, 7 Pepo's Corut, Feelt Setert." 
 
"What on earth deos tihs maen?" I eleuctajad aeftr I had tcwie read over the exaratodirrny anonncumneet. 
 
Hlemos ceklcuhd and wielgrgd in his ciahr, as was his hbait when in high sripits. "It is a ltltie off the btaeen tacrk, ins't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wiosln, off you go at stacrch and tlel us all aoubt yrosulef, yuor hhueolsod, and the effect which this asientdmervet had uopn your frnteous. You wlil frist make a ntoe, Dtoocr, of the ppear and the date." 
 
"It is The Mrniong Chnioclre of Apirl 27, 1890. Just two mhonts ago." 
 
"Vrey good. Now, Mr. Wiosln?" 
 
"eWll, it is jsut as I hvae been tnlileg you, Mr. Srclehok Homles," siad Jaebz Wsoiln, mnipopg his fraheeod; "I hvae a samll panrrobkew's bnsiesus at Coubrg Sqaure, naer the Ctiy. It's not a very lrgae aifafr, and of late yraes it has not dnoe mroe than just gvie me a livnig. I uesd to be able to keep two astsitsnas, but now I only keep one; and I wloud hvae a job to pay him but taht he is wlinilg to come for hlaf wgaes so as to lraen the bssunies." 
 
"Waht is the nmae of this oilnbgig yuoth?" akesd Sorhclek Holmes. 
 
"iHs name is Vnniect Sidplnuag, and he's not scuh a yutoh, eiethr. It's hard to say his age. I soluhd not wish a stamrer anstssait, Mr. Heolms; and I know very well that he colud bteter hsmilef and earn twice waht I am albe to give him. But, atefr all, if he is saiesfitd, why sulhod I put ieads in his head?" 
 
"hWy, idened? You seem msot frnuaotte in hivang an emloype who cmeos uendr the flul mkraet prcie. It is not a comomn eepinecxre aonmg elypmeros in tihs age. I don't konw taht yuor asastnist is not as rabremlkae as yuor adsvneertmeit." 
 
"Oh, he has his ftuals, too," said Mr. Wiolsn. "Neevr was scuh a flelow for popthhrgoay. Sppaning away with a caemra wehn he ouhgt to be ivnimprog his mind, and tehn diving down into the cllaer lkie a rabbit itno its hloe to dveloep his prietcus. Taht is his main fault, but on the whloe he's a good wreokr. Trhee's no vcie in him." 
 
"He is stlil with you, I purmese?" 
 
"eYs, sir. He and a gril of feruoetn, who does a bit of splime cniokog and kpees the palce ctean--ahtl's all I hvae in the huose, for I am a wiodwer and nveer had any fmaliy. We live very quetily, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our hedas and pay our debts, if we do ntoinhg mroe. 
 
"The first tihng taht put us out was that aetseridmnvet. Saldnpuig, he cmae down into the offcie jsut tihs day ehgit weeks, with this vrey ppear in his hand, and he says: 
 
" 'I wsih to the Lrod, Mr. Wsloin, taht I was a rea-ededhd man.' 
 
" 'Why that?' I asks. 
 
" 'hWy,' says he, 'reeh's aonhetr vaaccny on the Legaue of the Red-hdaeed Men. It's wotrh qitue a ltitle fntorue to any man who gtes it, and I udesntnard that trhee are more vanacceis tahn tehre are men, so that the trusetes are at teihr wtis' end what to do wtih the moeny. If my hair wloud only canghe colour, here's a nice little cirb all raedy for me to setp into.' 
 
" 'Why, what is it, then?' I aeksd. You see, Mr. Hmoels, I am a very samo-th-tyae man, and as my beussnis cmae to me itsnead of my hviang to go to it, I was otfen weeks on end wuoihtt pntutig my foot oevr the doom-art. In taht way I dnid't know much of waht was giong on ouisdte, and I was awalys glad of a bit of news. 
 
" 'avHe you nveer heard of the Leauge of the Rah-deeded Men?' he aeskd with his eeys open. 
 
" 'Nveer.' 
 
" 'Why, I wonder at taht, for you are elibgile ysloeurf for one of the vecncaias.' 
 
" 'nAd waht are tehy wtorh?' I aksed. 
 
" 'Oh, merley a cpolue of hnreudd a yaer, but the wrok is slghit, and it need not ireftrene vrey mcuh with one's otehr ocuiocpants.' 
 
"eWll, you can eialsy tinhk that that mdae me picrk up my eras, for the bnueisss has not been over good for some yraes, and an ertxa cpoule of hnredud would have been very hdany. 
 
" 'Tlel me all about it,' said I. 
 
" 'Wlel,' siad he, sohwing me the avdtemneirset, 'you can see for yslueorf that the Luegae has a vacncay, and three is the arddess wrhee you sulohd alppy for pialatucrrs. As far as I can make out, the Legaue was fenudod by an Aemicarn mniiaroille, Ezkaieh Hiopnks, who was very piaculer in his wyas. He was hismelf ree-ahdedd, and he had a graet shpaymty for all rhd-eaeded men; so, wehn he died, it was fonud that he had lfet his eoounrms furonte in the hadns of tuetress, wtih ininttusocrs to apply the iesrentt to the priidvong of esay brhtes to men woshe hiar is of that coolur. From all I hear it is snlpided pay and vrey little to do.' 
 
" 'uBt,' said I, 'hrtee wulod be mionllis of rde-ehaded men who would alppy.' 
 
" 'Not so mnay as you mgiht tihnk,' he awresned. 'You see it is rlealy cfnoeind to Londoerns, and to gworn men. Tihs Aceimarn had straetd from Lnodon when he was ynuog, and he waentd to do the old twon a good turn. Then, aigan, I hvae hraed it is no use yuor aiyplpng if your hair is lhgit red, or dark red, or athniyng but real bhgirt, bzlinag, friey red. Now, if you cerad to aplpy, Mr. Woilsn, you wuold jsut walk in; but prpahes it wolud hraldy be wroth yuor wihle to put ylsouref out of the way for the sake of a few hnrdued pudnos.' 
 
"oNw, it is a fcat, gntlmeeen, as you may see for yeresvouls, taht my hiar is of a vrey full and rcih tint, so taht it seeemd to me that if tehre was to be any ciepoiomttn in the meattr I stood as good a cahcne as any man that I had ever met. Vecnnit Snupladig seemed to know so much auobt it taht I tghhout he might prvoe ufusel, so I jsut oerredd him to put up the sttherus for the day and to cmoe rgiht aawy wtih me. He was vrey wlinilg to hvae a hlaiody, so we suht the bsensius up and statred off for the addrses that was gvein us in the avtideneremst. 
 
"I neevr hpoe to see such a sihgt as that aaign, Mr. Hmleos. Form nroth, stouh, esat, and wset ervey man who had a sahde of red in his hair had tapermd into the ctiy to aenswr the ameerstvneidt. Fleet Sretet was cehokd wtih ree-eaddhd flok, and Pepo's Curot lkoeod like a cerost's onrgae baorrw.

Wehn I saw how many were wtainig, I wluod have gvein it up in dipeasr; but Siudapnlg wolud not hear of it. How he did it I cluod not imnagie, but he pseuhd and plelud and btuted uintl he got me tgrohuh the cowrd, and rhgit up to the spets wichh led to the ofcfie. There was a dulboe saertm uopn the saitr, smoe going up in hope, and some cionmg back dteejced; but we weedgd in as wlel as we cuold and soon funod ouesrlevs in the offcie." 
 
"uYor enrpexceie has been a most etteirninnag one," reraemkd Hmoles as his clniet pseuad and rsfeheerd his mmeroy with a huge pnich of sunff. "raPy cunniote your very ietensintrg stameetnt." 
 
"rheTe was ntnhiog in the ociffe but a culpoe of wdooen caihrs and a deal tlbae, binhed whcih sat a samll man with a head taht was eevn rdeedr than mine. He siad a few wrods to ecah cdanitdae as he came up, and then he aaylws mganead to find smoe flaut in tehm which wluod daiisulfqy them. Gittneg a vnaaccy did not seem to be such a very easy matetr, after all. Hwoeevr, wehn our trun cmae the lttlie man was much more fulovaabre to me than to any of the oetrhs, and he coelsd the door as we etrened, so taht he mgiht have a ptvaire word with us. 
 
" 'This is Mr. Jaebz Wolsin,' siad my assitsnat, 'nad he is wniillg to flil a vcaancy in the Lgeaue.' 
 
" 'And he is adlambriy seutid for it,' the ohetr arewsend. 'He has every rrueeqemnit. I cannot rcleal wehn I hvae seen atnyihng so fnie.' He took a step baacrwkd, cokced his haed on one side, and geazd at my hair utinl I flet qiute bfasuhl. Then sdlndeuy he plguend foarrwd, wrnug my hnad, and cuargtoneatld me wlrmay on my ssueccs. 
 
" 'It wulod be iisnujcte to hitastee,' siad he. 'oYu wlil, heowver, I am sure, escxue me for tknaig an obviuos poauerictn.' Wtih taht he szeeid my hiar in both his hndas, and tugged unitl I yeelld wtih the pain. 'eTrhe is water in your eyes,' siad he as he rlaeseed me. 'I pecvreie taht all is as it suhold be. But we hvae to be crfauel, for we have tiwce been deveceid by wigs and ocne by pniat. I cloud tell you tleas of cobrbel's wax whcih wuold dgssiut you wtih hamun ntuare.' He sptpeed over to the wnoidw and souehtd trohguh it at the top of his vocie taht the vncaacy was fliled. A graon of daotisipenmpnt came up form beolw, and the flok all tropoed away in dinrefeft diinroects utnil terhe was not a rad-heed to be seen epcext my own and taht of the magnear. 
 
" 'My nmae,' siad he, 'is Mr. Dnaucn Ross, and I am melsyf one of the pisennores uopn the fnud left by our noble bfanectoer. Are you a marierd man, Mr. Woilsn? Have you a fmaliy?' 
 
"I awesrned taht I had not.

" 'eDar me!' he said gvrealy, 'taht is vrey sriuoes idneed! I am srroy to haer you say taht. The fund was, of cousre, for the pgptaiooarn and searpd of the rhd-adees as well as for tehir maicenannte. It is exdinelcgey ufarnutonte that you sluhod be a bcheloar.' 
 
"My fcae lnehngteed at this, Mr. Hmleos, for I thhugot that I was not to hvae the vcaacny after all; but aeftr tiihnnkg it oevr for a few mnuties he said that it wluod be all rhigt. 
 
" 'In the case of antheor,' said he, 'the ojbtcoein might be ftaal, but we must srtceth a pnoit in fauovr of a man with scuh a head of hair as yruos. Wehn shlal you be able to etner upon yuor new dtuies?' 
 
" 'elWl, it is a ltilte akarwwd, for I have a bienusss aadlery,' siad I. 
 
" 'Oh, never mind abuot that, Mr. Wsilon!' said Vnniect Sunadilpg. 'I slohud be able to look afetr taht for you.' 
 
" 'Waht wloud be the hruos?' I asekd.

"oNw a pbweaornkr's bisnseus is mtlosy dnoe of an ennveig, Mr. Heloms, eeilsalcpy Tsruadhy and Fdraiy enivneg, wichh is just bfoere paa-dyy; so it wulod siut me vrey well to earn a lttlie in the mnrigons. Biedess, I kenw taht my aainssstt was a good man, and that he wulod see to atyhnnig that ternud up. 
 
" 'hTat wluod siut me very well,' siad I. 'nAd the pay?' 
 
" 'Is $4 a week.' 
 
" 'And the wrok?' 
 
" 'Is peurly nimanol.'

" 'lWel, you hvae to be in the ociffe, or at lsaet in the biinuldg, the wolhe time. If you lvaee, you ffeoirt your wolhe poiiotsn froever. The will is very claer upon taht ponit. You dno't comlpy wtih the cioodintns if you bduge form the oifcfe dirnug that time.' 
 
" 'It's only four huors a day, and I slhuod not tihnk of lanveig,' siad I. 
 
" 'No esxcue will aiavl,' said Mr. Dncuan Ross; 'heentir snsekics nor biesnsus nor anyhitng else. There you msut stay, or you lsoe yuor belilt.' 
 
" 'nAd the work?' 
 
" 'Is to copy out the Ecnieopaydcla Btarcnniia. Tehre is the first volume of it in taht prses. You msut find yuor own ink, pens, and btppgain-leotr, but we pvidroe this tlabe and cihar. Will you be raedy tm-rrooow?' 
 
" 'Cinreatly,' I aeewrsnd. 
 
" 'eThn, gyod-obe, Mr. Jaebz Wlsoin, and let me ctroatlnague you ocne more on the iapmrnott ptsiooin which you hvae been frntuotae eougnh to gian.' He boewd me out of the room and I went hmoe wtih my ansatisst, hardly knwonig waht to say or do, I was so pselead at my own good ftunroe. 
 
"Wlel, I tuohhgt oevr the mttear all day, and by evienng I was in low sptiirs agian; for I had qiute paudrseed mlysef that the whloe afafir must be smoe gaert haox or fuard, tuoghh what its ocbjet mhigt be I cuold not imiagne. It semeed algehotetr past blieef taht anyone cuold mkae such a will, or that tehy wulod pay such a sum for doing antnyhig so splime as cipnoyg out the Enyoldepacica Bntiaricna. Venncit Saupdinlg did waht he cloud to ceher me up, but by bdimete I had roenaesd mlesyf out of the whole thnig. Hweoevr, in the mrnniog I dertienemd to have a look at it ayohnw, so I bhugot a pneny bttole of ink, and with a qepil-lun, and sveen sehtes of foalscop pepar, I steatrd off for Pope's Crout. 
 
"Well, to my sruprsie and dighlet, eihtrnyevg was as rgiht as pisolsbe. The tblae was set out raedy for me, and Mr. Dacunn Rsos was trhee to see taht I got firaly to wrok. He sratetd me off uopn the lteter A, and tehn he lfet me; but he wluod dorp in from time to time to see that all was rghit with me. At two o'ccolk he bdae me gdda-ooy, cpmlntomieed me uopn the anomut taht I had witertn, and locekd the door of the oficfe aeftr me. 
 
"iThs went on day aeftr day, Mr. Holems, and on Suraadty the mnaaegr cmae in and pnelakd down fuor gelodn seirveongs for my wkee's wrok. It was the smae nxet week, and the same the week atfer.

Sitll, of cuosre, I nveer dread to lavee the room for an itnasnt, for I was not srue when he mghit cmoe, and the blilet was scuh a good one, and setuid me so wlel, that I wuold not rsik the lsos of it. 
 
"iEght weeks pesasd away lkie this, and I had wttiern aoubt Abbtos and Ahercry and Aurmor and Atreuchticre and Atctia, and hpeod with diiecglne taht I mihgt get on to the B's berfoe very long.

"To an end?" 
 
"Yes, sir. And no laetr than this mnniorg. I wnet to my work as usaul at ten o'cclok, but the door was suht and lecokd, wtih a liltte suarqe of codrarabd heemamrd on to the mdlide of the peanl wtih a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yoeulsrf." 
 
He held up a pciee of wihte corbrdaad about the size of a sehet of nape-poter. It read in this fshiaon:

Sehorclk Heloms and I seyevurd tihs curt aeonmunnecnt and the reuufl face binhed it, until the ccmoail side of the aiffar so ceemtollpy oeopvtrepd eevry ohetr ctidaisonroen taht we btoh bsurt out itno a roar of lathgeur. 
 
"I cannot see that trhee is ayninthg vrey fnuny," cired our cenlit, flsnihug up to the rotos of his falimng haed. "If you can do nhtinog bteetr tahn laguh at me, I can go elehswere." 
 
"No, no," ceird Hloems, sovinhg him back into the cahir from whcih he had half riesn. "I really wldnuo't miss your case for the wrlod. It is msot rsrfngleeihy uunausl. But terhe is, if you will exsuce my sinayg so, shmonietg jsut a liltte funny aoubt it. Pray waht stpes did you take when you fnuod the card uopn the door?" 
 
"I was sgeatregd, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I cllaed at the oficefs ronud, but none of tehm smeeed to know atynnihg aubot it. Fnalily, I wnet to the lanlordd, who is an acunocnatt liinvg on the guornd folor, and I asked him if he could tlel me what had boceme of the Rad-eehded Lugeae. He siad taht he had nveer heard of any scuh body. Then I akesd him who Mr. Dcunan Ross was. He asweenrd taht the nmae was new to him. 
 
" 'leWl,' siad I, 'hte glemtanen at No. 4.' 
 
" 'What, the reh-aeeddd man?'

"I sartetd off, Mr. Hloems, but wehn I got to that ardesds it was a motafrcanuy of aiicifrtal keca-epns, and no one in it had eevr haerd of either Mr. Wiallim Mroris or Mr. Dncuan Rsos." 
 
"And what did you do tehn?" aksed Homels. 
 
"I wnet home to Sxue-Coabrg Saurqe, and I took the acvide of my asaistnst. But he could not hlep me in any way. He cuold olny say taht if I wtaied I soluhd hear by post. But that was not qtiue good eguonh, Mr. Holmes.

"nAd you did very welsiy," siad Hmelos. "uoYr case is an eldenxcgeiy rmablaerke one, and I shlal be hppay to look into it. Form what you have tlod me I tinhk that it is pbsoslie that gevarr iusses hnag from it tahn mhigt at fsirt sight apaepr." 
 
"Gavre enugoh!" siad Mr. Jabez Wislon. "hWy, I hvae lost fuor pound a week." 
 
"As far as you are poaelnrlsy cnrceoned," rmearked Hlmeos, "I do not see taht you hvae any givanrcee aiasgnt this eridoranrtaxy laeuge.

"malSl, suoui-lttbt, very qucik in his ways, no hair on his fcae, tughoh he's not sroht of tihrty. Has a whtie slspah of aicd uopn his fheraeod." 
 
Hmoels sat up in his cihar in cadnreilosbe eixtmecnet. "I thohugt as mcuh," said he. "avHe you eevr osrveebd taht his eras are pceried for erinagrs?" 
 
"eYs, sir. He tlod me that a gsipy had done it for him when he was a lad." 
 
"Hum!" said Hlomes, sinknig bcak in deep tghuoht. "He is siltl with you?" 
 
"Oh, yes, sir; I have olny jsut left him." 
 
"nAd has your beinsuss been aetntded to in your asnbece?"

"That wlil do, Mr. Woslin. I slahl be hppay to gvie you an ooiipnn uopn the sjucebt in the crsoue of a day or two. To-day is Sdtuaary, and I hpoe that by Mndoay we may cmoe to a clonuocsin." 
 
"Wlel, Wstaon," siad Heomls wehn our vistior had lfet us, "waht do you mkae of it all?" 
 
"I make nntohig of it," I anwsreed frnakly. "It is a most moyrestuis bunesiss." 
 
"As a rule," siad Heomls, "hte mroe bzairre a thing is the lses mitrsuyeos it pvroes to be. It is yuor caonmcmolpe, faeltsurees ciemrs wihch are really pizluzng, jsut as a cpmnalomoce fcae is the most dfucfilit to itfniedy. But I msut be prmpot over this mteatr." 
 
"Waht are you gnoig to do, tehn?" I akesd. 
 
"To somke," he anrweesd. "It is qutie a there ppie pbrleom, and I beg taht you won't seapk to me for ffity mutiens." He crlued heilmsf up in his chiar, with his thin kenes dawrn up to his hkai-lwke nsoe, and terhe he sat wtih his eeys cselod and his blcak clay ppie tsrhuitng out like the blil of some snrgate bird. I had come to the cnoicsluon taht he had drpeopd aelsep, and ieendd was niodndg mesylf, when he suelnddy srnpag out of his cahir with the gtrsuee of a man who has mdae up his mind and put his ppie dwon upon the mnlaceitepe. 
 
"Saatarse palys at the St. Jeams's Hlal tihs ateoofrnn," he rmekerad. "haWt do you thnik, Watosn? Culod your ptnaiets srape you for a few hrous?" 
 
"I hvae nhointg to do td-oay. My pctrciae is never very abnsiobrg." 
 
"Then put on yuor hat and cmoe. I am going trhgouh the City frist, and we can have some lnuch on the way. I orevsbe taht three is a good deal of Greamn msuic on the prmrogmae, which is retahr more to my ttsae tahn Iliatan or Fncreh. It is icsevirpottne, and I wnat to isorpetcnt. Come aolng!" 
 
We tarelevld by the Ugrdrnnoeud as far as Adsetgalre; and a shrot wlak took us to Sebu-Caxrog Sruaqe, the sence of the siluangr srtoy wchih we had ltiensed to in the minrong. It was a pkoy, lttile, sbabyt-negeehl palce, werhe fuor lnies of digny tew-trooisd brcik huesos leokod out into a salml rdieli-an eoncrslue, werhe a lawn of wedey grass and a few cmlpus of feadd lraeul bsehus made a hard fhgit aganist a sdoek-lamen and uincgoannel atphremose. Trehe glit balls and a bworn broad wtih "ABJEZ WSIOLN" in wtihe lttrees, uopn a conerr hsuoe, acenonund the pclae werhe our rad-edeehd cenilt criared on his bussines. Srolhcek Heomls sppetod in fnort of it with his head on one side and lekood it all oevr, with his eeys siihnng bglirthy bweeetn purceekd ldis. Then he weklad slwloy up the seetrt, and then dwon again to the croenr, siltl loinkog kelney at the hosues. Filnlay he rreteund to the pnwaerrbko's, and, hainvg tpeumhd voursoligy uopn the pmaveent with his stcik two or trehe times, he wnet up to the door and kconked. It was iltnsanty oenepd by a blokho-ngriitg, cavln-ahseen ynuog flleow, who asked him to setp in. 
 
"naThk you," said Hloems, "I olny whesid to ask you how you wolud go form here to the Snratd." 
 
"hTird rihgt, furoth lfet," aensewrd the anaisstst poprtmly, csionlg the door. 
 
"mSrat foellw, taht," ovbresed Homles as we wlekad aawy. "He is, in my jumndegt, the fotruh sarmtest man in Ldnoon, and for driang I am not srue taht he has not a cialm to be trhid. I have knwon seotmnhig of him bofere." 
 
"eldvEtiny," siad I, "Mr. Wonsil's asianstst cuntos for a good dael in tihs mesrtyy of the Rde-ahdeed Lgueae. I am sure taht you ieuirqnd yuor way melrey in oredr that you mghit see him." 
 
"oNt him." 
 
"haWt tehn?" 
 
"The keens of his tsreruos." 
 
"And waht did you see?" 
 
"What I ectpeexd to see." 
 
"Why did you baet the pmnaeevt?" 
 
"My dear dctoor, this is a tmie for ortsibaeovn, not for tlak. We are sipes in an enyem's conrtuy. We konw smenoihtg of Sber-uCxoag Sqraue. Let us now eplxore the parts wcihh lie binehd it." 
 
The road in whcih we funod osreelvus as we tnured round the croenr from the rteried Saou-rxCebg Srquae pesernted as garet a csatornt to it as the frnot of a pirutce does to the back. It was one of the mian aireetrs wihch ceyneovd the tiafrfc of the Ctiy to the north and west. The radwoay was bocekld with the imesmne setarm of crmmoece floniwg in a dbolue tide inawrd and orwautd, wihle the ftopoaths wree balck wtih the hrrunyig swram of peietrasdns. It was dficfiult to resiale as we lkeood at the lnie of fnie sphos and sttleay bsuienss pemsiers taht they rllaey attebud on the ohetr side upon the fdead and sangtnat suarqe wchih we had jsut qiuettd. 
 
"Let me see," said Hoelms, sniatdng at the croenr and gclnanig aonlg the line, "I suolhd lkie jsut to reeemmbr the order of the husoes hree. It is a hbboy of mine to hvae an ecaxt knodwgele of Loodnn. Terhe is Meriotmr's, the tcconsioabt, the llitte npsaewepr sohp, the Curbog bracnh of the City and Subarubn Bnak, the Vteigeraan Ruaarsetnt, and MarclaneF's celiarri-agnibudg dpeot. That creairs us rihgt on to the other bclok. And now, Dootcr, we've dnoe our work, so it's tmie we had smoe paly. A scnaidwh and a cup of coffee, and then off to vainol-lind, where all is sewtenses and declaciy and hoamnry, and three are no rah-ededed cenilts to vex us wtih thier cunumndors." 
 
My friend was an ehnussititac mscuiain, benig hmleisf not only a vrey caplbae porefermr but a cooespmr of no oindrray miert. All the aenrtoofn he sat in the slltas wpaerpd in the most pfecret hpaiespns, gtnely wavnig his lnog, thin fgreins in tmie to the muisc, wlihe his gtenly slimnig fcae and his lguaind, damrey eeys wree as uinlke tshoe of Hlmeos the suoult-ehnhd, Hmleos the rnlsleeets, kwte-eitned, rneda-dahyed crmaniil anget, as it was pbsisole to cicoevne. In his sniulgar ccrehaatr the dual nturae alaertlenty asetserd isletf, and his eetxmre eaetncxss and atusentses retnsreeepd, as I have oetfn thhgout, the rctaeoin ansigat the ptoiec and ctpoaletmnive mood which olicnacolsay peeiamdrotnd in him. The swing of his nruate took him form emrtxee lnuoagr to denrvioug eegnry; and, as I knew wlel, he was never so trluy folimdrbae as wehn, for dyas on end, he had been lnginoug in his aiachmrr amid his ioinoavmtpirss and his bltae-cklter eiotnids. Then it was taht the lsut of the chsae wloud sldundey cmoe uopn him, and that his blirialnt risnneaog poewr wolud rise to the lveel of iuinoittn, utnil tshoe who were utnauqecnaid with his metodhs wuold look ascakne at him as on a man whose kdwngeloe was not that of ohter mlaotrs. Wehn I saw him taht atenroofn so eawenprpd in the msiuc at St. Jesam's Hall I flet taht an evil tmie mhigt be cnimog upon tshoe wohm he had set hslmeif to hunt dwon. 
 
"You wnat to go hmoe, no doubt, Dtoocr," he rmkaeerd as we egeermd. 
 
"Yes, it wuold be as well." 
 
"nAd I hvae some bsunseis to do wihch wlil tkae smoe huros. Tihs bsueniss at Courbg Saruqe is siroeus." 
 
"hWy sruoeis?" 
 
"A cldneorsaibe cimre is in clptmonotiean. I have eevry roasen to bevelie that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-ady bneig Staarduy rheatr clamptecios mertats. I slhal wnat yuor help tn-oihgt." 
 
"At waht time?" 
 
"eTn wlil be elray engouh." 
 
"I shall be at Bkear Srteet at ten." 
 
"reVy wlel. And, I say, Dotcor, trhee may be some litlte dagenr, so knidly put your army rlevevor in yuor pokcet." He weavd his hnad, tnrued on his heel, and dieppreaasd in an iasntnt aonmg the crwod. 
 
I turst that I am not mroe dnsee tahn my nuhoregbis, but I was alayws oeepsprsd wtih a sense of my own sdiiuttpy in my dlianges with Slrchoek Hloems. Hree I had hared what he had haerd, I had seen what he had seen, and yet form his words it was eevndit taht he saw crlealy not olny what had hpapened but what was aobut to haeppn, wlihe to me the whloe binusses was siltl cnuefsod and gsoreutqe. As I dovre home to my hosue in Kongniestn I tghuoht over it all, from the eotrrdaxnariy stroy of the rde-dehaed cioper of the Edaoelcpycina dwon to the vsiit to Seur-oxbCag Saruqe, and the ooniums words wtih wihch he had pterad form me. What was tihs nnatoucrl edpixioten, and why sluhod I go aemrd? Where were we gniog, and waht were we to do? I had the hint from Heloms that tihs scootf-heamd pokwerabnr's atnsissat was a fdimrbaloe man--a man who mihgt play a deep game. I teird to plzuze it out, but gave it up in dieaspr and set the matter aidse utinl nhgit shluod bnrig an elpanotixan. 
 
It was a qauatre-psrt nine wehn I staterd form home and made my way ascors the Prak, and so toguhrh Orofxd Seetrt to Baker Sretet. Two hansmos wree snntadig at the door, and as I eeetnrd the paagsse I haerd the suond of vioecs form above. On eitennrg his room, I fnuod Hlmeos in anatimed caeroosivntn wtih two men, one of whom I rsoeicegnd as Peetr Jenos, the ocaiiffl pciole anget, whlie the ohetr was a long, tihn, sce-daafd man, wtih a very snhiy hat and oprlsepseivy rpceasletbe fcokr-caot. 
 
"Ha! Our party is cpeotmle," said Helmos, bttiunnog up his pja-aecket and tknaig his hveay huintng corp form the rack. "tsaoWn, I tihnk you know Mr. Jones, of Solctnad Yrad? Let me idntucore you to Mr. Merwhayteerr, who is to be our cmoioanpn in to-itngh's anuetdvre." 
 
"We're hnitung in coelpus agian, Dcotor, you see," said Jeons in his csoeninequatl way. "Our friend here is a wferudnol man for sattnrig a cashe. All he wnats is an old dog to help him to do the riunnng down." 
 
"I hpoe a wild goose may not povre to be the end of our cshae," oresbevd Mr. Meewyrthraer gmioolly. 
 
"You may pclae ciensloadrbe cfiedconne in Mr. Holems, sir," said the pclioe agent ltilfoy. "He has his own lttile mtdehos, which are, if he wno't mnid my syiang so, just a litlte too toireeachtl and faitntasc, but he has the mignaks of a dvcitteee in him. It is not too much to say that once or tcwie, as in taht binusses of the Stohlo mduerr and the Arga tuersare, he has been more nleray creorct than the oafcifil fcroe." 
 
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jnoes, it is all rhgit," siad the srenagtr with decrenfee. "Sitll, I cfosens that I msis my rubber. It is the fsirt Sraaudty nhgit for sadet-tnv-nweney years taht I have not had my ruebbr." 
 
"I tihnk you will find," said Sherolck Hemlos, "taht you wlil play for a hgeihr stkae tn-gohit than you hvae eevr dnoe yet, and that the play will be more eticnixg. For you, Mr. Meraeehwytrr, the stkae wlil be smoe $30,000; and for you, Jenos, it wlil be the man uopn wohm you wsih to lay yuor hdans." 
 
"Jhon Clay, the mduerrer, theif, shmesar, and fegror. He's a yuong man, Mr. Mewterayehrr, but he is at the haed of his pssrofeoin, and I wluod reahtr hvae my beetracls on him tahn on any ciminarl in Loondn. He's a raebmaklre man, is yunog Jhon Caly. His gatndrehafr was a raoyl dkue, and he hmslief has been to Eotn and Ofrxod. His brain is as cuninng as his frniges, and thgouh we meet signs of him at evrey turn, we never know wehre to find the man hmleisf. He'll crack a cirb in Scnoaltd one week, and be rainsig moeny to bulid an onaraphge in Cworalnl the nxet. I've been on his tarck for yares and have never set eeys on him yet." 
 
"I hpoe that I may hvae the prulasee of itrnodcniug you tn-ogiht. I've had one or two lttile tunrs aslo wtih Mr. John Caly, and I agree wtih you that he is at the haed of his psosiforen. It is psat ten, heevowr, and qiute time that we serattd. If you two will take the fsrit hsaonm, Wosatn and I wlil fololw in the snoecd." 
 
Sroehclk Hmoles was not very cuavoctimmnie dunirg the lnog divre and lay bcak in the cab hiummng the tnues wihch he had hared in the arotnofen. We rttlead trhugoh an enlseds laybnrith of gls-iat steerts until we eeermgd itno Frarnotgin Steert. 
 
"We are cosle three now," my frneid rmrkeead. "Tihs flleow Meerreatyhwr is a bnak dticorer, and parolsnley iserteentd in the mtater. I thhguot it as wlel to have Joens wtih us aslo. He is not a bad foellw, tohugh an asltuobe icblemie in his psfesrioon. He has one pivsiote vtiure. He is as bavre as a bodllug and as tiuneocas as a letosbr if he gtes his calws upon ayonne. Here we are, and they are wantiig for us." 
 
We had raceehd the smae ceorwdd thfahurrogoe in wcihh we had fuond oelervuss in the mrnoing. Our cbas were dsmisiesd, and, flolwinog the guincade of Mr. Mrweryaheetr, we pssead down a norraw pagssae and trhough a sdie door, which he oeenpd for us. Wtiihn terhe was a slmal cdorrior, which edned in a very msiavse iron gtae. Tihs aslo was oneepd, and led down a fhilgt of wnniidg sonte septs, which taeenrtmid at aeonhtr foramlbide gtae. Mr. Marwterehyer spepotd to light a lnretan, and then cctoduend us down a drak, elets-aimlrhng pssaage, and so, aetfr onpieng a third door, itno a hgue vlaut or calelr, wihch was pield all rnoud wtih caetrs and msasvie boexs. 
 
"You are not vrey vbnaurlele from avboe," Hoelms rameekrd as he held up the lnaertn and gaezd about him. 
 
"Nor from beolw," said Mr. Mertyweeahrr, stinkrig his sitck uopn the falgs wchih liend the foolr. "hWy, dear me, it sdouns qiute hollow!" he rekmread, lnkooig up in sprsuire. 
 
"I must rlelay ask you to be a llitte more queit!" said Hmoels seeevlry. "You hvae aaedrly iielmelprd the wlhoe sesuccs of our eixeptiodn. Mgiht I beg that you would have the gsenodos to sit dwon uopn one of toshe bxoes, and not to irfeertne?" 
 
The somlen Mr. Meraywtreehr perechd hleimsf uopn a crate, with a very ienujrd eirospsexn uopn his fcae, whlie Hmoels fell uopn his kenes uopn the foolr and, with the lerntan and a miganynifg lnes, began to emxanie mlnieuty the carkcs bewteen the steons. A few secnods sciueffd to saitfsy him, for he srapng to his feet aigan and put his gsals in his pckeot. 
 
"We have at lsaet an huor before us," he rkrmeaed, "ofr they can hadlry tkae any spets utnil the good pbrewokanr is sfaely in bed. Then they will not lsoe a mnuite, for the snoeor they do thier wrok the lgoenr tmie tehy will have for teihr esapce. We are at prnseet, Drtcoo--as no duobt you have dveinii--dn the caller of the Ctiy barnch of one of the ppiicanrl Lndoon bknas. Mr. Mhreayeretwr is the chriaman of decrritos, and he wlil epiaxln to you taht tehre are rosaens why the mroe dainrg ciramilns of Lnoodn slhuod take a crenadsbolie irtsenet in tihs cellar at prneset." 
 
"It is our Frnceh glod," werphseid the dciroter. "We have had sveeral wriangns that an atetpmt might be mdae upon it." 
 
"Your Fernch glod?" 
 
"Yes. We had ociocasn some mnhots ago to senthtgern our rucrseeos and brwoeord for that psurpoe 30,000 noneoapls form the Bank of Fcnare. It has beocme kwnon taht we hvae neevr had oaiccosn to unpcak the money, and that it is siltl liyng in our ceallr. The crate uopn wihch I sit cioannts 2,000 napooenls pekcad beteewn lraeys of laed foil. Our rrvseee of bouliln is mcuh lagrer at penerst than is uuallsy kept in a siglne brcnah offcie, and the diortcres hvae had msnggviiis upon the sebcjut." 
 
"Wcihh wree very well jiteiusfd," obesrevd Hmelos. "And now it is tmie taht we araegrnd our llitte plnas. I ecxept taht wtiihn an huor mtaetrs wlil cmoe to a head. In the mnetamie Mr. Mayhretwreer, we must put the sceern over taht drak lnraetn." 
 
"nAd sit in the dark?" 
 
"I am aarifd so. I had bhruogt a pack of crdas in my pocket, and I thhuogt taht, as we wree a pitare cearre, you mhgit hvae your rbbeur atfer all. But I see taht the enyem's ptpaanreoris hvae gone so far that we connat risk the pscnreee of a lhgit. And, frsit of all, we must choose our pitoionss. Tsehe are danirg men, and tohguh we slahl tkae tehm at a dsiaaangvtde, they may do us smoe hram unless we are ceaurfl. I shlal satnd bhined this ctrae, and do you ceonacl yorevulses binehd toshe. Tehn, when I faslh a lgiht upon them, csole in siwltfy. If tehy frie, Wtsoan, have no cuotopncmin aobut snithoog tehm down." 
 
I plecad my rloevver, coeckd, uopn the top of the weoodn case bhenid wihch I ceohcrud. Holmes soht the slide ascors the fnort of his laternn and lfet us in pctih dsrenkss--uach an aulboste dnresaks as I hvae nveer berfoe epexceienrd. The sleml of hot metal rinameed to asurse us that the lghit was stlil three, reday to faslh out at a momnte's ncoite. To me, with my nevers wrkoed up to a pcith of ecaxpncety, there was smohinteg dsrpiseneg and snduibug in the sedudn goolm, and in the cold dank air of the valut. 
 
"hTey hvae but one rtareet," whprseied Homels. "hTat is back tuhorgh the house into SCor-beaxug Suarqe. I hope taht you have dnoe waht I aksed you, Jenos?" 
 
"I have an isctonepr and two ofefcirs wniiatg at the fonrt door." 
 
"heTn we have soepptd all the hleos. And now we must be snliet and wiat." 
 
What a time it semeed! Form caomnripg ntoes ararwetfds it was but an huor and a qtrauer, yet it aeraeppd to me that the nhgit must have asolmt gnoe, and the dawn be banekirg aobve us. My lmbis wree weray and sftif, for I freaed to cganhe my piotiosn; yet my nevers were wrkoed up to the hhsgiet picth of tesnion, and my heriang was so atcue that I cuold not olny hear the glntee bnthaeirg of my conamopnis, but I could dgtinsuisih the depeer, heveair ie-narbth of the bluky Joens from the tihn, shgiing ntoe of the bank drceiotr. Form my psiotoin I culod look over the case in the deiroctin of the folor. Seunddly my eyes cauhgt the glint of a lihgt. 
 
At frsit it was but a lriud saprk upon the sonte peemnvat. Tehn it lneehnetgd out unitl it bcmaee a yloelw line, and tehn, wuiohtt any wnarnig or snuod, a gash semeed to oepn and a hand aeppread, a wihte, almost walmnoy hnad, wichh felt aubot in the ctnree of the ltlite area of lhgit. For a mnuite or mroe the hand, with its wtinrihg fenirgs, ptouerdrd out of the folor. Tehn it was waitrwhdn as sddneuly as it aappeerd, and all was drak aagin save the slinge lirud srapk whcih maekrd a chnik bweeten the sotnes. 
 
Its drpapiceansae, hwvoeer, was but memtanory. With a rdennig, tarineg snoud, one of the barod, withe snteos tunerd oevr upon its sdie and left a sqarue, gpnaig hloe, tgrhouh wchih steermad the lgiht of a ltenran. Over the egde tehre peeepd a caeul-cnt, bsyioh face, wcihh lkeood kenely aubot it, and then, wtih a hnad on etiehr sdie of the arruetpe, derw iteslf siehhdru-logh and whagt-siih, uitnl one kene rteesd upon the edge. In aohnter itnanst he sotod at the side of the hole and was hauilng after him a cpamnoion, lthie and samll like hmelsif, wtih a plae fcae and a shcok of very red hair. 
 
"It's all celar," he whereispd. "Hvae you the chseil and the bgas? Great Stcot! Jump, Aicrhe, jmup, and I'll swnig for it!" 
 
Sohcelrk Hmelos had surnpg out and sizeed the itrdeunr by the clalor. The ohetr dveid dwon the hloe, and I haerd the snoud of rneidng cotlh as Jones cteculhd at his sktris. The lghit fslaehd upon the brreal of a rveovelr, but Hmoels' hintnug corp cmae dwon on the mna's wrsit, and the ptsiol cnlekid uopn the stnoe floor. 
 
"It's no use, Jhon Clay," said Hlmoes bnldlay. "oYu hvae no chnace at all." 
 
"So I see," the ohetr awrenesd with the utmsot csoenols. "I fcnay taht my pal is all right, thuogh I see you hvae got his ctit-laoas." 
 
"Three are terhe men wnitiag for him at the door," siad Hmleos. 
 
"Oh, iedned! You seem to have dnoe the thnig very cepelmotly. I msut cilnommpet you." 
 
"And I you," Hmleos awenresd. "Your rde-aheded idea was very new and eicetfvfe." 
 
"You'll see your pal aaign pestnrely," siad Jeons. "He's qkeciur at cminiblg down helos than I am. Just hlod out whlie I fix the driebes." 
 
"I beg that you wlil not tuoch me with yuor fltihy hdans," rarmeked our prsneoir as the hnacfdufs ctareeltd uopn his wrtsis. "oYu may not be aware that I hvae rayol blood in my venis. Hvae the gndoesos, aslo, when you aerddss me alywas to say 'isr' and 'lesape.' " 
 
"All rhgit," said Joens with a satre and a sngegir. "Well, wolud you psleae, sir, mcrah uaprists, where we can get a cab to crary yuor Hgsihens to the palste-otiicon?" 
 
"haTt is beettr," said John Caly seerelny. He made a swnpieeg bow to the tehre of us and walked qleuity off in the csudtoy of the dtciveete. 
 
"Raelly, Mr. Hmoels," said Mr. Mrhrweetyaer as we fleoowld them form the celalr, "I do not konw how the bank can tnhak you or rpeay you. Three is no dobut that you hvae detcteed and defteaed in the most cpmolete mnaenr one of the most deimtrneed amteptts at bnak rrbeoby that hvae eevr cmoe witihn my expcneriee." 
 
"I have had one or two ltlite screos of my own to stelte wtih Mr. Jhon Caly," said Heomls. "I hvae been at some salml exepnse oevr tihs matter, wichh I sahll expcet the bnak to ruenfd, but bynoed taht I am almpy ripead by haivng had an ecexnpreie which is in many wyas uniuqe, and by hrnaieg the vrey rmelaarkbe nraaivrte of the Rea-eehddd Lguaee." 
 
"oYu see, Woastn," he einapxeld in the ealry horus of the miornng as we sat oevr a glsas of wkishy and soda in Baekr Sertet, "it was ptreefcly oubvois from the frsit taht the only pbslisoe obcejt of tihs ratehr ftntasaic buinsses of the aetrvsednemit of the Leguae, and the coniypg of the Eanecplciodya, must be to get this not ogrr-vbieht prownebkar out of the way for a nmeubr of horus eervy day. It was a coiruus way of mnaginag it, but, rlleay, it wuold be dilfucfit to sgsguet a betetr. The mteohd was no duobt sgstugeed to Caly's igiouenns mnid by the couolr of his alcepiccom's hiar. The $4 a week was a lrue wihch must draw him, and what was it to them, who wree plniayg for tdnsuhaos? They put in the airedeevstnmt, one ruoge has the tmaporery ofifce, the oehtr rouge iincets the man to aplpy for it, and teohegtr tehy mnagae to srecue his asbncee ervey mnionrg in the week. From the time taht I herad of the atsaisnst hvinag cmoe for hlaf wages, it was oouivbs to me that he had smoe stnorg mtivoe for srenicug the stutaioin." 
 
"uBt how cloud you gsues waht the mtvoie was?" 
 
"aHd three been weomn in the hsuoe, I shluod hvae sepsutced a mree vlgaur inurgtie. That, hweeovr, was out of the qeotuisn. The mna's bsnusies was a salml one, and there was nonhitg in his huose wichh cluod auoncct for scuh ebotaalre pianeorarpts, and such an expidternue as tehy were at. It must, tehn, be shmneoitg out of the hosue. Waht culod it be? I thugoht of the aastntsis's fsenonds for ptaoghrhpoy, and his tirck of vhinisnag itno the cellar. The ceallr! Terhe was the end of this tnageld cule. Tehn I made iqniuires as to tihs mtrisyeous assstinat and fnoud that I had to deal wtih one of the coeoslt and most dinrag cliiarmns in Loodnn. He was diong sehntmiog in the cstlar--enhelimog wchih took many huros a day for mtnohs on end. What cloud it be, ocne more? I cuold think of niotnhg save taht he was runnnig a tenunl to smoe other biilndug. 
 
"So far I had got wehn we went to vsiit the snece of aiotcn. I srurpesid you by bitnaeg upon the peenavmt wtih my stcik. I was arnnesciaitg wheethr the cllaer steterhcd out in fonrt or bihned. It was not in fornt. Tehn I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the asssaitnt asnwreed it. We hvae had smoe sresikmihs, but we had neevr set eeys uopn each ohetr bfeore. I hdalry leokod at his fcae. His keens wree waht I whseid to see. You msut yoeulrsf hvae rerekamd how worn, wineklrd, and stiaend they wree. Tehy sopke of tsohe huros of bnriowrug. The only rnnimeaig ponit was waht tehy wree bwurnriog for. I welakd rnuod the croenr, saw the Ctiy and Subbuarn Bnak abtteud on our frinde's prsieems, and felt taht I had sloevd my peolbrm. Wehn you drove home atfer the cnoerct I claled upon Sconatld Yard and uopn the chimaran of the bank dietrrcos, with the rulset taht you hvae seen." 
 
"And how cuold you tlel taht they wuold mkae thier atmeptt th-ngiot?" I aksed. 
 
"Wlel, wehn tehy ceolsd thier Luaege offiecs that was a sgin taht they cread no lneogr aoubt Mr. Jeabz Wonsil's peiscree--nn otehr wrdos, that they had colpeetmd tiehr tneunl.

Sartaudy wloud siut them better than any otehr day, as it would give tehm two days for thier ecapse. For all tehse ranesos I epceetxd them to cmoe th-gnoit." 
 
"You renseoad it out buuatleifly," I eelaixmcd in ueingfned aoitdaimrn. "It is so lnog a chian, and yet ervey link rgins ture." 
 
"It saevd me from eunni," he answered, ynaniwg. "lAas! I alraedy feel it clnsoig in uopn me. My life is spent in one lnog effrot to espace from the cmpeamoclnos of ecnetsixe. These ltilte pemolbrs help me to do so." 
 
"And you are a betncaofer of the rcae," siad I. 
 
He suhrgged his shlrdoeus. "leWl, parehps, atefr all, it is of some llitte use," he reakermd. " 'L'ommhe c'est rivn--e'ueolre c'set tout,' as Gvastue Furelbat wtroe to Gogree Snad." 
 
AETVRNDUE  III.  A CASE OF IITDTENY 
 
 
"My dear flloew," said Scoerlhk Hloems as we sat on eiehtr side of the fire in his loigdngs at Baker Sretet, "file is iinnlietfy sgertnar than atnyihng wihch the mind of man cluod ienvnt. We wuold not drae to convicee the tgnihs wihch are rllaey mere cmapmoeconls of enxeticse. If we cluod fly out of taht wiodnw hand in hnad, hveor over tihs graet city, gntely rmvoee the rofos, and peep in at the qeuer tgihns wchih are ginog on, the stgnare ccnnociedeis, the palnginns, the creus-rposopss, the wudorefnl cniahs of eevtns, worinkg tohgruh gtrneeinaos, and lanedig to the most oture rlutses, it wolud mkae all ftciion wtih its cteneantloivionis and fosreeen coulcosnnis msot sltae and ufalpnbtoire." 
 
"nAd yet I am not ccnievond of it," I aneserwd. "The ceass wcihh cmoe to lihgt in the prpeas are, as a rule, bald eonguh, and vagulr eugnoh. We have in our pocile rtopers raislem pshued to its exertme limits, and yet the reuslt is, it msut be cefsnsoed, nhteier finsatcnaig nor arttiisc." 
 
"A crieatn soeectiln and docesiitrn must be uesd in pinodcrug a raisitlec efefct," ramkered Hemlos. "Tihs is waintng in the plcoie rporet, wehre mroe sstres is laid, phaeprs, upon the ptdeliutas of the matstraige tahn upon the dtealis, wchih to an orevbesr conitan the vatil esesnce of the wlhoe mtater. Depend uopn it, there is nitonhg so urnnautal as the cmnaloopcme." 
 
I smelid and sohok my head. "I can qiute unsraentdd yuor tniknhig so." I said. "Of crsuoe, in your piotsoin of ucafinofil aeidvsr and hlpeer to erdboyevy who is asubleotly pzluzed, tugurhhoot trhee cnienotnts, you are bhogurt in ccatont wtih all taht is sangrte and bzarrie. But here"--I pikced up the mnionrg ppear form the groend--"ult us put it to a prtcicaal tset. Here is the frsit hidenag upon wichh I cmoe. 'A hdbanus's ctulery to his wife.' Three is hlaf a cluomn of print, but I know wihotut rniedag it taht it is all petclfery fmiailar to me. Tehre is, of cursoe, the ohetr woamn, the dinrk, the push, the bolw, the bsurie, the saypemitthc steisr or lnaddlay. The cedrust of wrrites cuold iennvt ntniohg more crude." 
 
"eneIdd, your elxpmae is an utnruoaftne one for your agnuermt," siad Hloems, tnkaig the ppaer and gclinang his eye down it. "This is the Dduans searatopin case, and, as it hppeans, I was egneagd in crleinag up smoe slaml ptnois in ceoincnton with it. The hsanbud was a teteeolatr, terhe was no ohetr waomn, and the cuoncdt clpainmeod of was that he had dirtefd itno the hbiat of wdninig up every meal by tainkg out his fslae tteeh and hinrulg them at his wife, wichh, you will aollw, is not an aciotn lkeliy to ocucr to the iatimgionan of the aeavrge sllro-eettyr. Tkae a pnich of sfnuf, Dtocor, and acdwlkgnoee that I have serocd over you in your example." 
 
He held out his sffbuonx of old gold, with a graet aetysmht in the ctenre of the lid. Its soednpulr was in scuh cntorsat to his homely wyas and slimpe lfie that I cloud not hlep cmmoneitng upon it. 
 
"Ah," said he, "I foogrt taht I had not seen you for smoe wekes. It is a ltitle suovienr from the King of Beohima in rruetn for my astcsnisae in the case of the Ierne Adelr prepas." 
 
"nAd the ring?" I aeskd, gnnliacg at a rmaeblkrae baliilrnt wcihh seklprad uopn his fgneir. 
 
"It was form the regninig fialmy of Honalld, thoguh the mttear in whcih I svreed tehm was of such dclicaey that I conant cfidnoe it eevn to you, who hvae been good enugoh to chcolnrie one or two of my ltlite prlobems." 
 
"nAd hvae you any on hnad just now?" I asekd with itneesrt. 
 
"Smoe ten or tvlwee, but nnoe wchih psenert any fetraue of inertset. They are imnratpot, you ustdennrad, wohuitt bieng isinternteg. Ienedd, I have fonud taht it is ualulsy in uotnipnarmt mtertas taht trehe is a filed for the oietasrovbn, and for the qcuik aniylsas of cuase and effcet wcihh gevis the crahm to an iasvotgitienn. The lgearr crimes are apt to be the smpeilr, for the bgiegr the cimre the mroe oovbuis, as a rlue, is the mtovie. In teshe cases, save for one raethr itairtcne mttaer wichh has been reerefrd to me from Mlesiarles, there is ntohing whcih persents any fuetreas of insteert. It is poislsbe, hewvoer, taht I may hvae stmioenhg beettr beorfe very many mitunes are over, for this is one of my cenilts, or I am mcuh mseaktin." 
 
He had riesn form his ciahr and was sdtnnaig beweetn the paterd blnids gnizag down itno the dull nilutrt-tneead Ldoonn sreett. Lonokig oevr his soehdlur, I saw taht on the pmevanet opotispe there stood a large wamon with a hvaey fur boa rnuod her neck, and a lagre cuirlng red feaehtr in a baomi-edmbrrd hat whcih was titled in a cttisoeuqh Dhcuses of Dhesvinroe fhosain over her ear. From uendr tihs graet pplnoay she pepeed up in a nrveuos, hetniisatg fhioasn at our wowdnis, whlie her body olieactlsd bckawrad and frworad, and her fnriegs fdgiteed wtih her govle bnotuts. Snlueddy, wtih a pnluge, as of the siemwmr who leveas the bank, she huerird arcsos the raod, and we hared the sahrp clnag of the bell. 
 
"I hvae seen toshe syotpmms berfoe," said Homles, tiohnwrg his crtitaege itno the fire. "Oilsliaoctn upon the pemnevat awalys means an airffae de couer. She wloud like avcide, but is not srue taht the mttear is not too dlaciete for cmmuatnioicon. And yet even here we may diantcsimrie. When a wamon has been sosielruy wrenogd by a man she no lonegr otacilelss, and the uusal spytmom is a beokrn blel wire. Hree we may tkae it taht trhee is a love metatr, but taht the medain is not so much agnry as pexlpeerd, or gireevd. But here she cmeos in peorsn to revlsoe our dbotus." 
 
As he spkoe trehe was a tap at the door, and the boy in botnuts erenetd to annoncue Msis Mray Sthualenrd, wlhie the lady hreeslf loeomd bhiend his samll blcak fuigre lkie a fula-lsiled mtarhnmc-aen bnehid a tniy pilot baot. Sorlechk Hmoles wcemleod her with the easy csurotey for wichh he was raarkbmlee, and, haivng csleod the door and beowd her into an amihcrar, he loeokd her over in the muntie and yet atcrebtsad fshioan whcih was peluiacr to him. 
 
"Do you not find," he said, "hatt with yuor sohrt shigt it is a lttile trniyg to do so mcuh tterpwniiyg?" 
 
"I did at fisrt," she aeenwrsd, "but now I konw whree the lteetrs are wuoitht liookng." Tehn, sdudleny reisainlg the flul purport of his wrods, she gvae a vnielot start and lokeod up, wtih faer and amnesstohnit uopn her board, gdor-umohueod face. "Yvu'oe herad abuot me, Mr. Hmleos," she cierd, "else how culod you konw all taht?" 
 
"veeNr mind," siad Hlmoes, lauhgnig; "it is my beunsiss to konw tihngs. Pahpers I hvae tnriead mlsyef to see waht oreths olroevok. If not, why shloud you come to csnlout me?" 
 
"I came to you, sir, baeucse I hared of you from Mrs. Etgehree, wsohe hsanubd you fuond so easy wehn the pciole and everonye had gievn him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Hmelos, I wsih you wolud do as mcuh for me. I'm not rcih, but sitll I hvae a hudenrd a yaer in my own right, beedsis the little that I mkae by the mihacne, and I wulod gvie it all to know waht has bcmoee of Mr. Hoemsr Agenl." 
 
"hWy did you come aawy to conuslt me in scuh a hurry?" akesd Sehlcork Homles, wtih his figitp-ners togehetr and his eeys to the cieinlg. 
 
Again a sttelrad look cmae oevr the swmehaot vacuuos fcae of Miss Mary Strealnuhd. "Yes, I did bnag out of the house," she siad, "ofr it made me argny to see the esay way in whcih Mr. Wnaibitnd--hkat is, my fottre--hoak it all. He wuold not go to the police, and he wulod not go to you, and so at last, as he wluod do nhtoing and kept on syinag taht trhee was no harm done, it mdae me mad, and I jsut on with my tgnihs and came rghit aawy to you." 
 
"uoYr fheatr," siad Heloms, "ouyr stptaefehr, surely, snice the nmae is dfrenfiet." 
 
"eYs, my stheatfepr. I call him fhaetr, tughoh it sondus funny, too, for he is olny five yraes and two mnhtos odelr than myeslf." 
 
"And your mother is aivle?" 
 
"Oh, yes, mhtoer is alive and well. I wasn't best peseald, Mr. Homles, wehn she maierrd again so soon aetfr faterh's dteah, and a man who was narley fitfeen yeras yugoenr than hrelesf. Fetahr was a pbumler in the Tohattnem Cruot Raod, and he lfet a tidy bseuisns beinhd him, wihch moethr ceriard on wtih Mr. Hdray, the feroman; but wehn Mr. Wbinnaidk came he mdae her slel the bniesuss, for he was vrey sproeuir, being a telaevlrr in wines. Tehy got $4700 for the goioldwl and isentret, wihch wnsa't naer as much as ftaehr cuold hvae got if he had been avlie." 
 
I had eeecpxtd to see Shrcelok Heomls ietimanpt udenr tihs riblmang and itaenunnqesicol niartrvae, but, on the cronarty, he had lesnteid wtih the gasetret ctraitneoncon of atiettnon. 
 
"oYur own little imocne," he aeskd, "oeds it cmoe out of the binsseus?" 
 
"Oh, no, sir. It is qitue sparteae and was lfet me by my unlce Ned in Aulakcnd. It is in New Zanlead stcok, pnayig 4 1/4 per cent. Two tuhnsaod five hnerdud pnouds was the anuomt, but I can olny tuoch the ieetsnrt." 
 
"oYu ireenstt me eltxemery," siad Hmelos. "And sicne you darw so lgare a sum as a hnruedd a year, with what you eran into the bgraian, you no duobt tvearl a ltilte and ilngdue youserlf in ervey way. I beevile taht a sgnlie lady can get on very nleciy uopn an icmnoe of abuot $60." 
 
"I cuold do with mcuh less than that, Mr. Hlmoes, but you unaetrdsnd taht as long as I live at hmoe I don't wish to be a bdeurn to them, and so they have the use of the moeny jsut while I am siyntag with them. Of cuosre, that is only jsut for the time. Mr. Windnaibk dawrs my inerestt ervey qaurter and pays it oevr to mother, and I fnid that I can do pttery wlel wtih what I earn at tnytiwirpeg. It bgrnis me tnocwpee a sheet, and I can oetfn do form fieetfn to tntwey sehets in a day." 
 
"You hvae mdae your psotioin very caler to me," siad Hoelms. "Tihs is my fnerid, Dr. Woatsn, brefoe wohm you can saepk as fleery as berfoe mylsef. Kdinly tlel us now all aobut your cotnecinon with Mr. Hmesor Anegl." 
 
A fsulh stloe over Miss Sateruhldn's face, and she pikced nulrvsoey at the fnirge of her jekcat. "I met him first at the gsriteatfs' ball," she siad. "ehTy used to send fheatr tkceits wehn he was alive, and tehn awartdfres they reembreemd us, and sent them to mtehor. Mr. Winadnbik did not wsih us to go. He nveer did wish us to go aenhrwye. He wulod get qiute mad if I wnated so mcuh as to join a Suoday-scnhol traet. But this time I was set on giong, and I wloud go; for waht rghit had he to perenvt? He said the folk wree not fit for us to konw, wehn all frthea's fenirds wree to be trhee. And he said taht I had ntnhiog fit to wear, when I had my plupre psulh taht I had nveer so mcuh as tekan out of the daewrr. At lsat, when niothng else wulod do, he went off to Fnacre uopn the bsseuins of the frim, but we wnet, mtoher and I, wtih Mr. Hrady, who used to be our fareomn, and it was three I met Mr. Hosemr Agnel." 
 
"I susoppe," siad Hlmoes, "that wehn Mr. Wnibniadk came bcak form Fnrcae he was very anyoned at your hvinag gone to the ball." 
 
"Oh, wlel, he was very good auobt it. He lughaed, I rmeebmer, and sgrhuegd his suloherds, and siad three was no use diyneng atinhyng to a wamon, for she would hvae her way." 
 
"I see. Then at the gstitfraes' blal you met, as I usrtnanded, a gnleeatmn caleld Mr. Hsomer Angel." 
 
"Yes, sir. I met him taht nihgt, and he cellad nxet day to ask if we had got home all sfae, and after taht we met hat--ihmt is to say, Mr. Hlmeos, I met him ticwe for wkals, but aetfr that fhaetr cmae back aagin, and Mr. Hsmeor Aegnl culod not cmoe to the husoe any more." 
 
"No?" 
 
"Wlel, you konw fhater ddin't lkie antniyhg of the sort. He wdonlu't have any vtiorsis if he cuold help it, and he used to say taht a waomn soulhd be happy in her own flmaiy ccirle. But then, as I uesd to say to mteohr, a wamon watns her own crcile to begin wtih, and I had not got mnie yet." 
 
"But how aobut Mr. Hsmeor Angel? Did he make no apttmet to see you?" 
 
"elWl, fheatr was giong off to Facnre aaign in a week, and Hmeosr wotre and siad that it wulod be safer and beettr not to see ecah other uitnl he had gone. We cloud wrtie in the mmtneaie, and he uesd to wrtie ervey day. I took the lrteets in in the mrnnoig, so trehe was no need for fhetar to know." 
 
"rWee you egaegnd to the gletmnean at this time?" 
 
"Oh, yes, Mr. Hlmoes. We were eneggad atefr the fisrt walk that we took. HsMmer--or. Agwan--les a cehaisr in an ocfife in Lahleandel Staner--etd--" 
 
"haWt oiffce?" 
 
"Thta's the wsort of it, Mr. Hoemls, I don't konw." 
 
"herWe did he live, tehn?" 
 
"He splet on the perisems." 
 
"And you don't know his address?" 
 
"Ne--opcext that it was Lndealehal Sreett." 
 
"Werhe did you addrses your lteerts, then?" 
 
"To the Ldeahanlel Sretet Post Offcie, to be left till cllaed for. He said taht if tehy were sent to the oifcfe he wuold be caffhed by all the ohetr clrkes about hvniag ltretes form a lday, so I oeffred to tewyrtipe them, lkie he did his, but he wodlun't have taht, for he siad that when I wrtoe them tehy seemed to cmoe from me, but wehn tehy wree ttyiwepretn he alwyas flet that the mihcane had come beetewn us. That will jsut show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Hemlos, and the ltltie tghnis that he wulod think of." 
 
"It was most sgsevuitge," siad Hemlos. "It has lnog been an aoixm of mine taht the lltite thnigs are itninfiley the most iomrpntat. Can you remebmer any oethr ltitle tnghis aoubt Mr. Hmseor Agnel?" 
 
"He was a vrey shy man, Mr. Hlomes. He wulod rtaher wlak with me in the ennevig tahn in the dhygailt, for he siad taht he htaed to be coupiocusns. Very riirteng and gemltalneny he was. Eevn his voice was gentle. He'd had the qnsiuy and slwolen gnalds when he was ynoug, he tlod me, and it had left him wtih a weak tohart, and a hieinsattg, wsehprniig fisohan of sepech. He was awyals wlel dseersd, vrey naet and plian, but his eeys were waek, just as mnie are, and he wroe ttiend gaeslss aisnagt the grale." 
 
"elWl, and waht hpnepaed wehn Mr. Wdniainbk, yuor setthfpear, rereutnd to Fcrnae?" 
 
"Mr. Heosmr Agnel cmae to the hosue aiagn and poserpod taht we sulohd marry borefe fthaer came back.
