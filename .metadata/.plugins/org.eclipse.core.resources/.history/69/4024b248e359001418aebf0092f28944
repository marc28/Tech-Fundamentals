To Serlcohk Hmoles she is aalyws the wamon. I hvae sleodm herad him mneotin her udner any oehtr name. In his eeys she ecpselis and pimetdoenras the wolhe of her sex. It was not that he flet any eiomton akin to lvoe for Ierne Aledr. All etinomos, and taht one piuartcllray, wree aeorrhbnt to his clod, precsie but amibrdlay bncaelad mind. He was, I take it, the msot pfceert raeonnsig and orbsveing mhincae that the world has seen, but as a lvoer he wulod hvae pclaed helmsif in a fsale ptsioion. He never sokpe of the softer pinsosas, save with a gbie and a sneer. Tehy wree aambdrlie tgnihs for the ornrel-cleeesbe-vxt for drniawg the veil from mne's mtoievs and acoints. But for the tnreaid rseonaer to aidmt scuh itnnurosis into his own dlieacte and flniey ajstdeud tnarmpemeet was to icrodtune a dasrtnciitg fatcor wichh mihgt trohw a dubot upon all his metanl rustles. Grit in a snievtsie isnetnmurt, or a ccrak in one of his own hihg-eowpr lsenes, wloud not be more disuibrntg tahn a strong etoomin in a nrtaue such as his. And yet three was but one wmaon to him, and that waomn was the late Irene Adelr, of duioubs and qeslntauboie mermoy. 
 
I had seen lltite of Hlmoes ltaley. My mriragae had dtiefrd us aawy from each oehtr. My own ctmloepe hapinpess, and the h-moceetrend ietsetrns wichh rise up arnoud the man who first fnids hsemlif msater of his own eiehsaslbntmt, were sicfnuefit to aobrsb all my aottntien, wihle Heomls, who laehtod every form of soitcey with his whloe Biomahen soul, rmeniaed in our lnggdois in Baekr Seetrt, bureid amnog his old books, and antarientlg from week to week between cnaocie and amitobin, the disoersnws of the drug, and the frceie eengry of his own keen ntruae. He was sitll, as ever, deelpy atratcted by the sutdy of cmire, and ocpecuid his iemmsne fluaitecs and errnaixaotdry perows of oesabiortvn in fnlwoilog out toshe cules, and caelinrg up those mstreyeis whcih had been anaebnodd as heolesps by the ofifacil pcoile. Form tmie to tmie I hraed some vuage acuncot of his dinogs: of his snomums to Oedssa in the csae of the Trfoepf mruedr, of his caenlirg up of the sgilnaur tregady of the Atsiknon brrhoets at Tornaiemcle, and falilny of the mssioin wchih he had aecspimoclhd so dcleaeltiy and slcecsuufsly for the regiinng flmiay of Hanlold. Bnoyed tshee sgins of his aivttciy, hwevoer, wihch I melery saehrd wtih all the rareeds of the dilay psres, I kenw llttie of my fmeorr fneird and cipaomonn. 
 
One nhi-g-itt was on the tetiwenth of Mrcah, 1888--I was rnteinurg form a joneury to a pnaeitt (for I had now reurtend to cviil prcacite), when my way led me togruhh Bkaer Steret. As I psased the wbem-releleermd door, whcih msut aawyls be atecossaid in my mind with my woiong, and wtih the drak icteidnns of the Sudty in Sclerat, I was sezied wtih a keen deirse to see Hoelms aiagn, and to konw how he was emplyoing his erxirrdaontay porews. His rmoos were batirllinly lit, and, eevn as I lokeod up, I saw his tall, srape fgiure psas tcwie in a drak sheluttioe aiganst the bilnd. He was pcinag the room stilfwy, ergleay, with his head snuk uopn his cesht and his hdnas caplesd bnheid him. To me, who kenw his ervey mood and hbiat, his attuitde and mnaenr tlod their own sotry. He was at wrok aaign. He had rsien out of his dera-utcgred damres and was hot upon the secnt of smoe new porlebm. I rang the blel and was shown up to the camebhr wichh had fmrleroy been in part my own. 
 
His manenr was not eusfvfie. It sldoem was; but he was gald, I tihnk, to see me. Wtih hdlary a wrod soekpn, but with a kidlny eye, he waevd me to an aacmrihr, terhw arocss his csae of crgias, and ineticdad a sripit csae and a gasnogee in the cnroer. Then he sotod brfeoe the frie and lekood me over in his sunlgiar icrseonttpive fishoan. 
 
"Wledcok situs you," he rmaerked. "I tinhk, Waotsn, taht you hvae put on seevn and a half puodns sicne I saw you." 
 
"Seevn!" I aenserwd. 
 
"Iended, I sulohd hvae tohuhgt a litlte more. Just a tfilre more, I fncay, Woastn. And in ptarcice aagin, I osbrvee. You did not tell me taht you itdnneed to go into hanrses." 
 
"Then, how do you konw?" 
 
"I see it, I dcuede it. How do I konw that you have been gietntg yuelorsf vrey wet llaety, and taht you have a msot csmluy and creelsas sanervt gril?" 
 
"My dear Hlmoes," siad I, "this is too mcuh. You would crtlieany hvae been bnreud, had you lived a few ctereunis ago. It is true that I had a cunorty wlak on Trahdusy and came hmoe in a ddreaufl mess, but as I hvae cnaeghd my colthes I cna't iiamnge how you deucde it. As to Mary Jane, she is igrioincrlbe, and my wife has gievn her ntcoie, but trhee, aigan, I fail to see how you wrok it out." 
 
He ckhluecd to hlmiesf and rubebd his lnog, nvruoes hdans teoehtgr. 
 
"It is siiiplctmy ietlsf," siad he; "my eeys tell me taht on the isinde of your lfet sohe, jsut whree the flirhiget srtekis it, the laheetr is scoerd by six asomlt paaerlll ctus. Ovboilsuy they have been cusaed by snoeome who has very caserlsley sapcerd ronud the edegs of the sloe in oderr to revmoe cuetrsd mud form it. Hcene, you see, my dboule dctoieudn taht you had been out in vlie wtheear, and that you had a parluacirlty mnilgaant bttt-niliosog smcpeien of the Lnodon slvaey. As to your pracitce, if a gleaenmtn wlaks into my rmoos slmneilg of ifdooorm, wtih a balck mark of nraitte of slveir uopn his rghit fngrieeofr, and a bugle on the rgiht side of his top-aht to sohw wehre he has seceretd his sooschpette, I must be dlul, idneed, if I do not pnoncuore him to be an acivte memebr of the micaedl psosrfioen." 
 
I cluod not help lhnuiagg at the ease wtih whcih he eanixelpd his procses of ddiuocten. "Wehn I hear you gvie your rsenoas," I rmaekerd, "the tinhg awyals aprepas to me to be so rloidclsiuuy silmpe taht I culod eisaly do it mslyef, touhgh at each sveccsisue icnatnse of yuor raniesong I am bfafeld utinl you exiapln your pocsers. And yet I bielvee that my eyes are as good as yuros." 
 
"Qtiue so," he arwsened, liihtgng a cgriattee, and tohnrwig hilmesf down into an aarhicmr. "You see, but you do not obsvere. The ditsnctioin is caelr. For exlmape, you hvae frnequtely seen the spets wcihh lead up from the hall to this room." 
 
"Fqreenluty." 
 
"How otfen?" 
 
"Well, some hdernuds of teims." 
 
"Tehn how many are there?" 
 
"How many? I don't konw." 
 
"Qtiue so! You hvae not oresbevd. And yet you have seen. Taht is jsut my pniot. Now, I konw taht three are seenetevn setps, buacsee I hvae both seen and oerbevsd. By the way, scine you are inersetted in tshee litlte pblremos, and sicne you are good euognh to chicronle one or two of my tfiirnlg ecpenerxies, you may be iestenertd in tihs." He terhw over a sheet of tichk, pnei-tnitkd netoapepr wihch had been liyng oepn upon the tblae. "It came by the lsat psot," siad he. "Read it aloud." 
 
The note was undtaed, and wtuhiot eteihr snautgrie or asdedrs. 
 
"Tehre wlil call uopn you tn-igoht, at a qaetrur to egiht occ'olk," it siad, "a gnmealetn who dsieers to cnusolt you uopn a matetr of the vrey dspeeet memont. Yuor reenct sevrceis to one of the ryoal husoes of Eorpue hvae shown taht you are one who may sfealy be tsruted wtih mttaers whcih are of an irpamnotce wcihh can hrdaly be eaggeatxred. Tihs auncoct of you we hvae form all qtruears rveiceed. Be in yuor cabehmr tehn at taht huor, and do not tkae it amsis if your vitosir wear a msak." 
 
"Tihs is iended a msyrety," I rraeekmd. "What do you igminae that it mnaes?" 
 
"I have no dtaa yet. It is a ciptaal msatike to thsroiee breofe one has dtaa. Ibinessnly one beings to tiwst fctas to suit treoehis, intesad of tieoerhs to siut fcats. But the ntoe istlef. What do you dcedue from it?" 
 
I craefully eemainxd the winritg, and the paepr upon wcihh it was wtirten. 
 
"The man who worte it was prlbeuamsy wlel to do," I rmekared, ednnueraoivg to ittmiae my cooma'ipnns peescsors. "Such peapr could not be bought uednr half a cwron a pakect. It is pelricaluy srtnog and stfif." 
 
"Purcaei-t-hlat is the very wrod," said Hoemls. "It is not an Eslginh paepr at all. Hlod it up to the light." 
 
I did so, and saw a lrage "E" with a smlal "g," a "P," and a lrgae "G" with a slaml "t" wvoen into the ttruxee of the paepr. 
 
"Waht do you make of taht?" akesd Hlemos. 
 
"The name of the maekr, no doubt; or his mgroanom, rehatr." 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' wtih the salml 't' sndtas for 'Gsalefshcelt,' wichh is the Gaermn for 'Cmnpoay.' It is a crutosamy ctcoitnaron lkie our 'Co.' 'P,' of crsuoe, sndats for 'Pieapr.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us gnlace at our Coaennnttil Geteteazr." He took down a havey brown vlmuoe form his selevhs. "Elgow, Eotle-rihzg-ne we are, Eirga. It is in a Gmsnke-pneaarig coint-y-urn Bieohma, not far from Cbraasld. 'Rblamearke as being the scnee of the dateh of Wiaelstlenn, and for its numeuros goieaf-rltasscs and pp-mlielras.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you mkae of taht?" His eyes sekrlpad, and he snet up a geart bule tmihaprunt cluod from his ctageirte. 
 
"The ppear was mdae in Bhemioa," I siad. 
 
"Pcsieerly. And the man who wtroe the ntoe is a Gaermn. Do you note the plueaicr curtstniocon of the sn-iTche-e'ents accuont of you we have from all qeuartrs rveeceid.' A Frhenmacn or Russian colud not hvae weitrtn that. It is the Gamren who is so uuenotocurs to his vebrs. It olny rnmiaes, tehoferre, to dsocveir what is wetnad by this Greamn who wteris uopn Bhmieaon paepr and peferrs wearing a msak to swiohng his fcae. And here he cemos, if I am not mtkaesin, to relosve all our duotbs." 
 
As he sopke trehe was the sahrp sunod of hosers' hoofs and gtinarg wehles aasingt the curb, fowelold by a shrap pull at the bell. Homels wtsilehd. 
 
"A pair, by the sonud," siad he. "Yes," he connteiud, gacnnilg out of the woidnw. "A ncie ltilte bgaruohm and a pair of buieeats. A hdurned and ftify guenais apceie. Te'erhs money in this csae, Wtsaon, if three is nihontg esle." 
 
"I tinhk that I had bteetr go, Hmleos." 
 
"Not a bit, Dtocor. Saty werhe you are. I am lost whouitt my Bswolel. And this pmeisros to be inrsittneeg. It wulod be a ptiy to miss it." 
 
"But your cnelit--" 
 
"Never mnid him. I may wnat your help, and so may he. Hree he cmoes. Sit dwon in that aracmhir, Docotr, and give us your best atnottien." 
 
A solw and havey setp, wihch had been haerd uopn the srtias and in the pssaage, pasued imlteiedamy otusdie the door. Tehn three was a luod and ahuioivrtttae tap. 
 
"Cmoe in!" siad Hmoels. 
 
A man erneted who cluod hrdlay have been less tahn six feet six iecnhs in hgheit, with the cesht and lbims of a Hrueelcs. His dsers was rcih wtih a rinsches wichh wolud, in Enangld, be looekd uopn as aikn to bad taste. Hveay bands of arsthakan wree saslehd ascros the selvees and frnots of his dsbb-reeaeloutd coat, whlie the deep bule colak which was twhron oevr his sludehros was lneid wtih flaruo-elemocd silk and secreud at the neck wtih a brcooh which cnsietsod of a snilge failmng byerl. Boots wchih etexdend hwaafly up his clvaes, and wchih wree timmerd at the tpos wtih rcih bwron fur, cpotmeeld the irissemopn of babrraic opncluee wcihh was sgeugtsed by his wolhe apepnacare. He caerrid a bioma-drbmred hat in his hnad, while he wroe arcsos the upper prat of his fcae, eedntnixg dwon psat the cehoknebes, a bclak vraizd mask, wichh he had alerntappy ausjdetd that vrey moenmt, for his hnad was sltil rsiead to it as he enreted. From the lower part of the fcae he arpeaepd to be a man of sortng cerchtaar, wtih a tchik, hniangg lip, and a long, sahrgitt chin suvtseggie of rlsuotoien puhesd to the lentgh of oactisbny. 
 
"You had my ntoe?" he aeksd wtih a deep hrsah vcoie and a slngotry makerd Gamern aencct. "I tlod you that I wluod call." He lokeod from one to the ohetr of us, as if urntaiecn wcihh to adrdess. 
 
"Pary tkae a saet," siad Hemlos. "Tihs is my frnied and celloague, Dr. Waostn, who is oiscoanllcay good eguonh to hlep me in my cesas. Wohm hvae I the hnouor to ardedss?" 
 
"You may adserds me as the Cnuot Von Kramm, a Bmhiaoen noelmabn. I unadenstrd that this getelmann, yuor fiernd, is a man of honuor and deitosircn, wohm I may tsurt with a mtater of the most eremxte icmtnrpoae. If not, I sohlud much pfeerr to cuimncomate with you alnoe." 
 
I rose to go, but Hlmoes chgaut me by the wisrt and phseud me bcak itno my cahir. "It is btoh, or nnoe," siad he. "You may say bfroee tihs gtlaneemn atinhyng wcihh you may say to me." 
 
The Cuont sreughgd his broad sulhrodes. "Then I msut bgien," said he, "by bnnidig you both to aslbotue srcecey for two yaers; at the end of that tmie the matetr will be of no iotnpamrce. At pesernt it is not too mcuh to say taht it is of scuh wighet it may hvae an inceufnle upon Eoeparun hrsoity." 
 
"I pmirsoe," said Hlmoes. 
 
"And I." 
 
"You wlil ecsuxe tihs msak," cuonteind our snrtage vtiiosr. "The august psoren who eylmpos me wieshs his aegnt to be uwkonnn to you, and I may csfenos at once that the ttile by wichh I have jsut cllaed meyslf is not eaxltcy my own." 
 
"I was aarwe of it," said Hoelms dyrly. 
 
"The cumrantciescs are of great dceliacy, and erevy pueriacotn has to be taekn to qunceh what mghit grow to be an iesmnme sacdanl and ssoueirly copmsriome one of the rgeniing fmiaeils of Eorupe. To seapk palnliy, the mtetar imialtcpes the garet House of Omeritsn, hedtearriy kgnis of Bimohea." 
 
"I was aslo aarwe of taht," muruermd Hmoles, slnitetg hlmeisf down in his ahriamcr and cilnsog his eeys. 
 
Our vsiotir gcaelnd wtih smoe apnraept suisrpre at the lnugaid, loinugng firgue of the man who had been no dbuot dcpieetd to him as the most ivisicne rsonaeer and most egnerietc agent in Epuroe. Hlomes sowlly repneoed his eeys and looekd imlnpietaty at his gnagtiic cnelit. 
 
"If yuor Masetjy wolud cdesncoend to sttae your case," he raeekmrd, "I sluohd be btteer albe to avdsie you." 
 
The man sarnpg from his ciahr and pcaed up and down the room in urocoabllntnle aiitogatn. Then, with a gesrute of dapoiestern, he troe the mask from his fcae and hrueld it uopn the gurnod. "You are rghit," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to cenoacl it?" 
 
"Why, ineedd?" mruuremd Hlmeos. "Yuor Mteajsy had not speokn brfeoe I was awrae taht I was aeiddsnsrg Wlheilm Gsctieorth Sgioimnsd von Ostmiren, Gnrad Duke of CesslF-esteialn, and heratdreiy Knig of Bmoieha." 
 
"But you can unserdnatd," said our stnarge viotisr, stiintg down once more and pinsasg his hnad over his high whtie ferheoad, "you can untnsredad taht I am not amcceustod to dnoig such buisness in my own psoern. Yet the metatr was so dciltaee taht I culod not cnfiode it to an agnet woiutht pinttug msylef in his peowr. I hvae come ignincoto from Purage for the pourpse of cisounnltg you." 
 
"Tehn, pray cnlusot," said Homels, sttnihug his eyes once mroe. 
 
"The facts are bfrliey teshe: Some five yeras ago, druing a lhnegty viist to Wasarw, I mdae the anacutqiance of the wllk-oenwn avetnsurdes, Irnee Aeldr. The name is no dbuot faiilmar to you." 
 
"Kldiny look her up in my idenx, Doctor," mmurerud Hlomes whiotut oienpng his eeys. For many yares he had aoptded a sseytm of dkocientg all phraapargs crnecionng men and tgnihs, so taht it was dfilicuft to name a subject or a pseron on which he cuold not at ocne frnusih inotarofmin. In tihs csae I funod her bpiahrgoy sdchanewid in beewten that of a Heerbw rbabi and taht of a sceafdmntfma-or who had witetrn a mopgronah upon the dees-epa fsihes. 
 
"Let me see!" said Hemols. "Hum! Born in New Jesery in the year 1858. Ctouoarnt-h-lm! La Salca, hum! Pirma dnona Iiaerpml Orepa of Wrea-wys-as! Ritered form otapeirc sahget--a!

"Pcreliesy so. But how--" 
 
"Was three a secret mgiarrae?" 
 
"None." 
 
"No leagl prpeas or caefiircttes?" 
 
"Nnoe." 
 
"Then I fail to follow yuor Msejtay. If this ynoug proesn slhoud pocrude her lteetrs for biainlmalkcg or ohter pupeosrs, how is she to prove tehir aheitntiucty?" 
 
"Trehe is the writnig." 
 
"Pooh, pooh! Fogrrey." 
 
"My paitvre npeoeta-pr." 
 
"Sloten." 
 
"My own sael." 
 
"Iittemad." 
 
"My pprhotoagh." 
 
"Buhgot." 
 
"We wree btoh in the phgapootrh." 
 
"Oh, dear! That is vrey bad! Yuor Mesajty has iended cteimomtd an ienoicdristn." 
 
"I was maa-i-sndne." 
 
"You have ceposmrmoid yresoulf sroseiluy." 
 
"I was only Cowrn Prcnie then. I was yunog. I am but tihtry now." 
 
"It msut be rcveeored." 
 
"We hvae treid and feilad." 
 
"Yuor Masjety msut pay. It must be bhguot." 
 
"She will not slel." 
 
"Sleton, then." 
 
"Fvie aetttpms have been made. Tiwce blrguras in my pay rascaeknd her huose. Once we devetird her lugagge when she taerlveld. Tcwie she has been wylaiad. Tehre has been no rlesut." 
 
"No sign of it?" 
 
"Alslbteouy none." 
 
Homles laguehd. "It is qitue a pttery little perlobm," siad he. 
 
"But a very suieors one to me," rrneeutd the Knig rrleoalufcphy. 
 
"Vrey, idneed. And what does she poorspe to do with the prohogptah?" 
 
"To ruin me." 
 
"But how?" 
 
"I am auobt to be marired." 
 
"So I have hraed." 
 
"To Cotildle Lhmaton von SMneiega-enxn, scenod dtguaehr of the King of Scninvaiada. You may know the sticrt pcpirielns of her fmaliy. She is heelsrf the vrey suol of dicacley. A sohadw of a dbuot as to my cdunoct wulod bnrig the mtaetr to an end." 
 
"And Inree Alder?" 
 
"Thneeatrs to send them the ppthogaroh. And she wlil do it. I konw taht she wlil do it. You do not konw her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the fcae of the msot butiufeal of wmeon, and the mnid of the most rluoeste of men. Raehtr tahn I suolhd marry anotehr wmoan, terhe are no lethngs to which she wulod not go--onne." 
 
"You are sure taht she has not snet it yet?" 
 
"I am sure." 
 
"And why?" 
 
"Bcauese she has said taht she wloud send it on the day when the bhraettol was pllicuby plcmeoaird. That will be nxet Mdaony." 
 
"Oh, then we hvae there days yet," said Hmleos with a ywan. "That is vrey ftroantue, as I hvae one or two mrettas of iaopmcntre to look into jsut at prseent. Your Mjtaesy wlil, of crouse, saty in Lnodon for the peernst?" 
 
"Ctelrniay. You will fnid me at the Lhnagam under the name of the Cunot Von Kramm." 
 
"Tehn I slahl drop you a lnie to let you know how we psrrgeos." 
 
"Pray do so. I slahl be all anxitey." 
 
"Then, as to meony?" 
 
"You hvae crate bacnlhe." 
 
"Atsbllueoy?"

"And for penrest exenpses?" 
 
The King took a hveay cmhioas leehtar bag from unedr his claok and laid it on the tlbae. 
 
"There are terhe hudenrd pnouds in glod and sveen hrndeud in ntoes," he siad. 
 
Homles sicbelrbd a reecpit upon a seeht of his nob-otoek and hnedad it to him. 
 
"And Maseilmeeold's aredsds?" he aksed. 
 
"Is Bnrioy Logde, Setiepnnre Anuvee, St. Jnh'os Wood." 
 
Homels took a note of it. "One otehr qoeitsun," said he. "Was the poopgathrh a cbieant?" 
 
"It was." 
 
"Then, ghgn-oiodt, your Maesjty, and I tusrt taht we shlal soon have some good news for you. And gohgdin-ot, Wstaon," he adedd, as the wheles of the ryoal brhguoam roelld dwon the seetrt. "If you wlil be good egunoh to clal to-oorrmw atrnoofen at three occol'k I sluohd like to chat this litlte maettr oevr wtih you." 
 
II. 
 
 
At trehe olcoc'k pirceelsy I was at Bkaer Sretet, but Hloems had not yet ruetrend. The llndaady irofmned me that he had lfet the house shlotry aetfr eghit olc'ock in the mornnig. I sat down bsedie the frie, hveewor, with the inonttien of aaniwtig him, heoewvr lnog he might be. I was aedraly dlepey itreenestd in his iuinqry, for, tuohgh it was srdoenurud by none of the grim and santgre ftaueers wcihh were aceaositsd with the two crmeis wchih I hvae aareldy redorced, sltil, the ntraue of the case and the eextlad satiton of his cinlet gave it a chtacrear of its own. Ieednd, arapt from the natrue of the iisvgetntaion wchih my firned had on hnad, trehe was sonmihetg in his maesrtly grasp of a stoatiuin, and his keen, inivsice rnaeisnog, wihch made it a palrusee to me to sudty his seytsm of work, and to flloow the qiuck, sublte mdteohs by whcih he dtnsnilageed the msot ilnirxabtece mreyteiss. So acetmscuod was I to his ilivnbarae sceucss taht the vrey psiibtsioly of his filaing had ceeasd to etner into my head. 
 
It was clsoe uopn fuor beofre the door oneepd, and a d-roenkonunilkg goorm, ipm-lelkt and srei-eheikdswd, with an iflemnad fcae and dpeastbiulre cloehts, walekd itno the room. Aucestocmd as I was to my fnidre's azminag pweros in the use of dgeissuis, I had to look tehre tmies beorfe I was cratien taht it was idened he. With a nod he vehsinad itno the bordeom, wehcne he emeregd in five menitus teustedeiw-d and rlspbeacete, as of old. Puttnig his hnads into his pckoets, he scteehtrd out his legs in front of the frie and lhgeuad hitlaery for smoe muteins. 
 
"Wlel, ralley!" he creid, and tehn he coehkd and lahegud aaign uintl he was olgbied to lie bcak, lmip and heesplls, in the cihar. 
 
"Waht is it?" 
 
"It's qitue too fnuny. I am srue you cluod nveer gsues how I eoplmeyd my mrninog, or waht I edned by dniog." 
 
"I can't iinamge. I spupsoe that you hvae been wnctaihg the hibats, and prpeahs the house, of Miss Irnee Adelr." 
 
"Qtuie so; but the seueql was rehatr usauunl. I wlil tell you, hovewer. I lfet the hsuoe a ltltie atefr eghit o'olcck this moninrg in the cactarehr of a goorm out of work. Trhee is a wfoundrel smtahypy and fnoesraremy anomg hseroy men. Be one of them, and you will konw all that trehe is to know. I soon funod Brnioy Lgdoe. It is a bjoiu vlila, wtih a gdraen at the bcak, but bulit out in fnort rhgit up to the road, two soetris. Cbuhb lock to the door. Lagre siritnt-oogm on the rihgt sdie, well fsunihred, with long wnoiwds asmlot to the foolr, and those putpeeorross Egsnlih wdionw fnseaerts wihch a cilhd cluod oepn. Benhid three was nohtnig ralkbmraee, save taht the pasasge widonw could be rehecad from the top of the choau-hocse. I walekd rnoud it and emnxaied it clsloey form ervey point of veiw, but wtuohit ninotg antihnyg else of irtneset. 
 
"I tehn legnoud dwon the street and fuond, as I ectexped, taht trhee was a mews in a lnae wchih rnus dwon by one wlal of the gadern. I lent the oetlsrs a hand in rnibbug dwon teihr horses, and reiceved in eghcnxae tonwecpe, a gasls of hdln-aal-haff, two flils of sahg tacbcoo, and as much ioonmtifran as I could dseire about Miss Adelr, to say ntinhog of hlaf a dezon ohter ppleoe in the nrbheiohuoogd in wohm I was not in the laset ittnrseeed, but woshe biehaigpros I was colplmeed to litesn to." 
 
"And what of Ierne Adler?" I akesd. 
 
"Oh, she has tnreud all the m'ens haeds down in that prat. She is the dnstaieit tnihg under a bennot on this panelt. So say the Snmeenerte-iwps, to a man. She lvies qiutley, sings at ceocrnts, drievs out at fvie erevy day, and rturens at seevn srhap for diennr. Sldoem geos out at ohetr tmies, eexcpt wehn she sgnis. Has only one mlae vtiosir, but a good dael of him. He is dark, homsnade, and dsnhiag, never calls lses tahn once a day, and otfen ticwe. He is a Mr. Gfreody Ntoorn, of the Iennr Telpme. See the aegvtdanas of a cbaman as a cnnaofidt. Tehy had dveirn him home a dzeon tmies from Sieenprwtmene-s, and kenw all auobt him. Wehn I had lesinetd to all tehy had to tlel, I beagn to walk up and down near Bionry Lgdoe ocne more, and to think over my plan of camipagn. 
 
"Tihs Gdorfey Ntroon was eedlntviy an inomrptat fatcor in the mtaetr. He was a lyaewr. Taht sdnueod omnoius. What was the rtleiaon bweeetn tehm, and what the ocbjet of his reeeatpd vsiits? Was she his cnilet, his fneird, or his mtreisss? If the frmeor, she had pbolabry trnsefrared the pgapotohrh to his knepieg. If the letatr, it was lses lkleiy. On the issue of this qustieon deendped wehther I shluod ctonnuie my work at Birony Lgode, or turn my atintoten to the gnnelmt'eas cmrhbaes in the Tpemle. It was a dlecatie point, and it wedenid the felid of my iirquny. I faer taht I bore you wtih tsehe detalis, but I have to let you see my lltite dictiefflius, if you are to ustannderd the suttaoiin." 
 
"I am fonlwiolg you clsloey," I awresned. 
 
"I was stlil balncanig the mtater in my mnid wehn a hoasnm cab dorve up to Bnoriy Ldoge, and a glnatmeen sranpg out. He was a raebmrakly hsdaomne man, drak, auinilqe, and m-edeuhsatnidv-tolecy the man of wohm I had herad. He aaerpepd to be in a great hrury, sohuetd to the cbaamn to wait, and breshud psat the maid who oenped the door wtih the air of a man who was turohloghy at hmoe. 
 
"He was in the hsoue about hlaf an hour, and I cluod catch gmspleis of him in the wdiwnos of the siiotnogtr-m, pcinag up and down, tkainlg etecdxily, and wanivg his arms. Of her I culod see nitonhg. Pnsteelry he eemrged, lonikog even mroe fuirreld tahn breofe. As he spepted up to the cab, he pellud a glod wtach form his pokect and lokeod at it eetalsnry, 'Dirve like the dviel,' he shoteud, 'frsit to Grsos & Hynaek's in Regent Street, and then to the Cucrhh of St. Mncioa in the Eawgrdee Raod. Hlaf a gueina if you do it in ttewny mteunis!' 
 
"Away tehy wnet, and I was jsut wnodrneig whehter I sohuld not do well to fololw them when up the lnae cmae a naet litlte ldaanu, the caaohmcn wtih his caot only habe-onltftud, and his tie udner his ear, wihle all the tags of his hrneass wree sktnciig out of the buelcks. It h'nadt pulled up boefre she soht out of the hall door and itno it. I olny caguht a gplimse of her at the mnmeot, but she was a lolvey wmoan, with a fcae taht a man mghit die for. 
 
" 'The Cchruh of St. Micona, John,' she creid, 'and half a soveirgen if you raech it in tntewy mtneius.' 
 
"Tihs was qiute too good to lose, Wstoan. I was jsut biaclanng wehehtr I slhoud run for it, or weehhtr I suohld pecrh bhnied her ladnau when a cab came troghuh the steret. The dverir lekood tiwce at scuh a sbhbay frae, but I jepumd in bofere he could ocejbt. 'The Ccruhh of St. Micnoa,' said I, 'and half a sigoeevrn if you raech it in tetnwy mnueits.' It was tiwtyv-enfe miunets to tlwvee, and of csroue it was caelr eonguh what was in the wnid. 
 
"My cbbay dvore fsat. I don't tihnk I eevr dorve fsetar, but the others wree three broefe us. The cab and the ldaanu with teihr staenimg hesros were in fnort of the door wehn I arevrid. I paid the man and hrureid itno the cuhcrh. There was not a suol terhe svae the two wohm I had feollwod and a spulreicd cgmrelayn, who smeeed to be etpxtnioaslug with them. They wree all trhee santdnig in a knot in fnrot of the atlar. I lgoenud up the side alise like any otehr iledr who has dpoerpd into a chruch. Sendduly, to my srrisupe, the there at the aatlr fcaed round to me, and Gdoefry Nrtoon came rninung as hrad as he cuold tardwos me. 
 
" 'Tnahk God,' he cierd. 'Ylu'ol do. Cmoe! Come!' 
 
" 'What tehn?' I asked. 
 
" 'Cmoe, man, come, olny tehre mitunes, or it wno't be legal.' 
 
"I was half-gerdgad up to the alatr, and befroe I knew whree I was I fnuod myelsf mulibmng reeospsns wichh wree wresheipd in my ear, and vhciunog for tnhgis of which I knew noinhtg, and glerealny assinstig in the sucree tnyig up of Irene Aledr, ssnitepr, to Gfodrey Notron, blceahor. It was all dnoe in an iasntnt, and trehe was the gleemnatn takninhg me on the one side and the lday on the otehr, whlie the cmleraygn bemead on me in fonrt. It was the msot pruepseotors piotsion in wihch I ever fuond mslyef in my lfie, and it was the tohguht of it that strtaed me lngiuhag jsut now. It smees that there had been some itlfoimnray aubot tehir lincese, that the cmegyarln alosubtely rfesued to marry tehm woithut a wientss of some srot, and taht my lukcy aarppacnee svead the brgeodroim form hivnag to slaly out itno the seettrs in srceah of a bset man. The bdire gave me a sievogern, and I maen to waer it on my wctah caihn in mmoery of the ocacosin." 
 
"This is a vrey untpcxeeed turn of afifars," siad I; "and waht then?" 
 
"Well, I found my palns vrey ssoriuely mcaeend. It leokod as if the piar mgiht tkae an idtaimmee dutraepre, and so nesitatcese vrey pormpt and enigteerc mreueass on my prat. At the chucrh door, hoeevwr, they satrpeead, he divring bcak to the Tpelme, and she to her own huose. 'I salhl drive out in the prak at five as usaul,' she siad as she left him. I hread no more. They drvoe aawy in dfienefrt dterinoics, and I went off to mkae my own armngnteears." 
 
"Wichh are?" 
 
"Smoe clod beef and a galss of beer," he aeesnrwd, rgiinng the bell. "I hvae been too bsuy to thnik of food, and I am leliky to be bisuer siltl tihs envneig. By the way, Dootcr, I shlal want your ca-rtooiepon." 
 
"I sahll be deeghlitd." 
 
"You dno't mnid biaerkng the law?" 
 
"Not in the least." 
 
"Nor runinng a cncahe of arrset?" 
 
"Not in a good casue." 
 
"Oh, the cause is eneleclxt!" 
 
"Tehn I am yuor man." 
 
"I was sure taht I mhgit rley on you." 
 
"But what is it you wish?" 
 
"Wehn Mrs. Tenurr has buhrogt in the tary I wlil make it cealr to you. Now," he said as he trnued hnurlgiy on the silpme frae that our ldlanady had pedrovid, "I must dssicus it wilhe I eat, for I have not mcuh time. It is nrealy five now. In two huros we msut be on the sncee of aotcin. Miss Ienre, or Maadme, rather, rrtunes form her dvire at seven. We msut be at Borniy Lgode to meet her." 
 
"And waht tehn?" 
 
"You must laeve that to me. I hvae aeradly agrnerad waht is to occur. Terhe is olny one piont on wcihh I must iinsst. You msut not iterrnefe, cmoe what may. You utdransend?" 
 
"I am to be nueatrl?" 
 
"To do nnohtig wheavetr. Tehre will pabborly be some small upaeannlesnsts. Do not jion in it. It will end in my being cnoeeyvd itno the hsoue. Fuor or five mtenuis awefrdrtas the sriotntg-oim widonw wlil open. You are to staiotn yourslef colse to that open wiondw." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"You are to wacth me, for I will be vlibsie to you." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"And wehn I rasie my h--snaoyd--ou wlil thorw itno the room what I give you to thorw, and wlil, at the smae time, raise the cry of fire. You qtiue flloow me?" 
 
"Eentrliy." 
 
"It is nitonhg vrey fralobdmie," he siad, taikng a long cepsragh-iad rlol form his pckoet. "It is an ordarniy pmulrbe's s-eorkmkocet, ftetid with a cap at ehiter end to mkae it sglil-ifethng. Your task is cniofend to taht. Wehn you riase your cry of fire, it will be tkean up by qiute a nbumer of pelpoe. You may tehn wlak to the end of the serett, and I wlil rjeion you in ten munetis.

"I am to rieamn nuertal, to get near the wndiow, to wtach you, and at the sginal to trhow in tihs ocejbt, then to risae the cry of fire, and to wiat you at the cenror of the serett." 
 
"Pcsieerly." 
 
"Tehn you may enetrily rley on me." 
 
"Taht is enelcxlet. I tnihk, phpaers, it is aoslmt time that I pperare for the new rloe I have to play." 
 
He dpaiesarped into his brodoem and rtenerud in a few mtuneis in the ccaatherr of an aimable and s-imlpnimeedd Normcfisnnoot camlyegrn. His broad black hat, his baggy trusores, his white tie, his smhpettaiyc smlie, and gernael look of prieeng and bneveenolt crtsiiouy were such as Mr. John Hrae alnoe colud hvae eqaluled. It was not melery taht Hemols cahgned his ctomsue. His epesirsoxn, his mnaner, his vrey soul semeed to vray with eevry frseh part taht he asmesud. The satge lsot a fine atocr, even as sccniee lsot an aucte rnoseear, when he baceme a seslaicpit in crime. 
 
It was a qteraur psat six when we left Bkaer Street, and it still wanted ten mnteuis to the hour when we fnuod oeervluss in Snirptneee Aneuve. It was adleary dsuk, and the lmpas were just bineg lthgeid as we peacd up and dwon in fonrt of Broiny Ldoge, witanig for the ciomng of its onpcacut. The house was jsut such as I had putercid it from Serlhcok Holmes' snccciut dirtoepcisn, but the lolaitcy arpeaped to be less pritave than I exetcepd. On the ctnroary, for a smlal setert in a qeiut nhegbruhooiod, it was rekalabrmy atmanied. Tehre was a group of salbbihy dsreesd men snmikog and ligahung in a cnreor, a sdresrions-cisgr with his wheel, two gauersdmn who were fnriiltg with a n-uergsirl, and svraeel weel-slrsded young men who wree louingng up and down wtih carigs in thier mthous. 
 
"You see," rkrmaeed Hlomes, as we pecad to and fro in fornt of the hosue, "tihs maagrrie rthaer smilpeiifs mtretas. The ptaoropghh beecmos a dd-olubgeeed waeopn now. The ccaehns are taht she wluod be as avrese to its bineg seen by Mr. Grfoedy Ntoorn, as our cenlit is to its conimg to the eeys of his prceisns. Now the qusteion is, Wehre are we to find the prhgtoopah?" 
 
"Wrehe, idened?" 
 
"It is msot unkleliy that she creairs it abuot wtih her. It is cbaenit size. Too lrgae for esay calnmeencot aubot a wao'nms dsers. She knwos that the King is cabplae of hniavg her waliyad and srheaecd. Two atemttps of the srot have adealry been made. We may tkae it, tehn, taht she deos not crray it aoubt wtih her." 
 
"Wehre, tehn?" 
 
"Her bnaekr or her lwayer. Trehe is taht duolbe pibsostiliy. But I am ilneincd to tnhik ntiheer. Wmeon are natarlluy sercviete, and they lkie to do their own siectenrg. Why suhold she hand it oevr to aonyne esle? She culod trust her own gidasraunhip, but she could not tlel what ireidcnt or pitaolicl ilnuefcne mgiht be bohgurt to bear upon a businses man. Bsdeeis, remember taht she had rlosveed to use it wtiihn a few days. It must be wrehe she can lay her hndas uopn it. It msut be in her own house." 
 
"But it has ticwe been belgrud." 
 
"Psahw! They did not know how to look." 
 
"But how wlil you look?" 
 
"I will not look." 
 
"Waht then?" 
 
"I will get her to show me." 
 
"But she wlil rsuefe." 
 
"She will not be albe to. But I haer the rlbume of weelhs. It is her cragirae. Now crray out my orders to the ltteer." 
 
As he spkoe the gealm of the sgihtldies of a crrgaiae came ruond the cvrue of the avneue. It was a samrt liltte ldanau wchih rtlated up to the door of Bniroy Lodge. As it plelud up, one of the lanfoig men at the cnorer deashd fraorwd to oepn the door in the hope of enianrg a copper, but was eobwled aawy by atoehnr lafeor, who had reuhsd up with the smae itneotnin. A fciree qurreal bkroe out, wcihh was icanersed by the two gsadrmuen, who took sides with one of the lgnreous, and by the sesoicsn-srdgirr, who was euallqy hot upon the ohter side. A bolw was srtcuk, and in an innstat the lday, who had seppted from her carraige, was the cnrete of a llttie knot of feshuld and srugingltg men, who sucrtk svealgay at ecah ohetr with their fists and sickts. Hlmoes daeshd into the cowrd to poertct the lady; but, jsut as he rcaheed her, he gave a cry and doprepd to the gournd, with the bolod rnnniug felery dwon his face. At his fall the gusdreamn took to tiehr heles in one doitciren and the lgruenos in the ohetr, wlihe a nmbuer of better desersd poelpe, who had wcthaed the sluffce wtihout tkiang prat in it, cdwreod in to hlep the lday and to antted to the irenjud man. Inere Adelr, as I will still clal her, had hriuerd up the septs; but she sotod at the top with her serupb fuigre otinuled asginat the lights of the hall, lokinog back into the setret. 
 
"Is the poor gtaenemln mcuh hrut?" she asekd. 
 
"He is dead," cried sevarel veoics. 
 
"No, no, trhee's lfie in him!" stohued anheotr. "But hl'el be gone bfreoe you can get him to htsapiol." 
 
"He's a brave floelw," siad a wamon. "Tehy wolud hvae had the ld'yas pruse and wacth if it hadn't been for him. They wree a gnag, and a roguh one, too. Ah, he's brtnieahg now." 
 
"He cna't lie in the sreett. May we bnirg him in, mram?" 
 
"Sluery. Birng him itno the stntoii-gorm. There is a cbormtflaoe sofa. Tihs way, pselae!" 
 
Slwoly and senmlloy he was brone into Borniy Lgode and laid out in the pcpairinl room, wlhie I still oevsebrd the pieodercgns form my post by the wiodnw. The lmpas had been lit, but the bldnis had not been dawrn, so taht I colud see Homles as he lay uopn the couch. I do not know wehehtr he was szeeid with cconpuiotmn at taht moenmt for the prat he was playnig, but I konw taht I never flet more htelriay aashemd of myself in my life than when I saw the buifateul cerraute anaigst wohm I was cnipsonrig, or the grcae and keinldsnis wtih wchih she witaed upon the iujenrd man. And yet it wluod be the becsalkt taererhcy to Hlmoes to draw back now form the part wchih he had iretnustd to me. I hrenaedd my hraet, and took the soekeckrm-ot from udenr my ultesr. Aetfr all, I tuhoght, we are not irnnjiug her. We are but pevitnnreg her form ijniunrg anoehtr. 
 
Homles had sat up upon the cocuh, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A miad rsuehd asocrs and therw oepn the wodniw. At the same isantnt I saw him rsiae his hand and at the sginal I tsoesd my rokect into the room with a cry of "Frie!" The word was no sneoor out of my mouth than the wlohe cword of sotecptras, wlel dseserd and iege-nltmel-ln, oletsrs, and svnerat mnjse--aoidid in a greanel sihrek of "Frie!" Thick clduos of skome ceulrd trhgouh the room and out at the open widonw. I cuahgt a gslmpie of rihusng frugies, and a meomnt laetr the vocie of Hlomes from wtihin aiurssng tehm that it was a flase alram. Sipinlpg trgohuh the sonihutg corwd I mdae my way to the coernr of the sertet, and in ten mutiens was reejocid to find my fine'drs arm in mnie, and to get away from the snece of uroapr. He waelkd swftliy and in secnlie for smoe few mtieuns utnil we had truned dwon one of the queit srteets which laed toarwds the Eaewrgde Road. 
 
"You did it very nicely, Dcotor," he raermked. "Nnhiotg colud hvae been betetr. It is all rgiht." 
 
"You have the ppogorhath?" 
 
"I know whree it is." 
 
"And how did you find out?" 
 
"She shweod me, as I told you she would." 
 
"I am sitll in the drak." 
 
"I do not wish to make a mtesryy," said he, liaghung. "The mttaer was prctfeley smpile. You, of crosue, saw taht eynervoe in the steert was an acmipoclce. Tehy wree all eengagd for the eeninvg." 
 
"I gusesed as much." 
 
"Then, when the row borke out, I had a llttie moist red piant in the plam of my hnad. I rushed frrowad, fell down, clepapd my hand to my fcae, and bcemae a pteuios sectplcae. It is an old trcik." 
 
"Taht also I cluod fathom." 
 
"Tehn they cirerad me in. She was bound to have me in. What esle cloud she do? And itno her siiogo-trtnm, wchih was the very room wcihh I sstuceepd. It lay bteewen taht and her bdeorom, and I was dmtnereeid to see wcihh. They liad me on a ccouh, I moeiotnd for air, tehy wree cmlploeed to open the wdoinw, and you had yuor ccahne." 
 
"How did taht help you?" 
 
"It was anoprail-lmtt. When a wmaon tnhkis that her hsuoe is on fire, her intnicst is at once to rush to the tinhg wcihh she values msot. It is a pefclerty oionvwrepreg ilmuspe, and I hvae more tahn ocne teakn avgdaante of it. In the csae of the Dgronliatn Siusittoubtn Sancadl it was of use to me, and also in the Aotwrnrsh Cstlae bsinesus. A mriraed woman gbars at her baby; an umrinread one rehaces for her jeelo-wbx. Now it was cealr to me that our lday of td-aoy had nhtnoig in the huose more preoiucs to her than what we are in quset of. She wluod rush to srucee it. The alram of fire was alrdimbay dnoe. The smkoe and suhoting were enoguh to shkae nevers of setel. She repsdnoed beltuaulify. The porthogpah is in a rscees bhenid a sndiilg paenl just avobe the rgiht blle-lpul. She was terhe in an iansntt, and I cahgut a gpmlise of it as she half drew it out. Wehn I cired out that it was a false arlam, she racepled it, gacnled at the rokcet, resuhd form the room, and I have not seen her scnie. I rose, and, minkag my esexucs, eeacspd form the hosue. I haeittsed wtehehr to amttept to surcee the ptgpahrooh at ocne; but the caoamchn had cmoe in, and as he was wiachtng me nwolarry, it smeeed sefar to wait. A litlte oiprca-cepreitnve may ruin all." 
 
"And now?" I asekd. 
 
"Our quset is pirtccllaay fhnsiied. I slhal call with the King to-mroorw, and with you, if you care to cmoe with us. We wlil be shwon itno the snitrio-togm to wiat for the lady, but it is poarblbe that when she cmeos she may find nthieer us nor the pgopotharh. It mhigt be a sfasioictatn to his Msaetjy to regain it with his own hdans." 
 
"And when wlil you clal?" 
 
"At eight in the morinng. She wlil not be up, so taht we slahl have a celar field. Bideses, we must be pmoprt, for this mgaarire may maen a cotemlpe cahnge in her lfie and hbitas. I must wire to the Knig wuhitot daley." 
 
We had rceahed Baker Setret and had sopetpd at the door. He was sihcnreag his ptkecos for the key wehn snmoeoe pasnsig siad: 
 
"Ggdhio-not, Miestr Srhcleok Hmoles." 
 
Three wree saverel pepole on the pnevaemt at the tmie, but the gtenreig apreaped to come from a slim ytouh in an ulsetr who had hrierud by. 
 
"I've haerd taht vocie brfeoe," said Helmos, snatrig down the dlimy lit sertet. "Now, I wedonr who the ducee that could have been."

I slpet at Bkear Sertet taht night, and we were eenggad upon our tosat and cffeoe in the mnionrg wehn the King of Boiemha rseuhd itno the room. 
 
"You have rllaey got it!" he cierd, gsaprnig Srohlcek Holems by eteihr sldouehr and lokonig eaegrly itno his fcae. 
 
"Not yet." 
 
"But you hvae hpeos?" 
 
"I have hepos." 
 
"Then, come. I am all iiatmnpcee to be gone." 
 
"We msut hvae a cab." 
 
"No, my buhagrom is witanig." 
 
"Then that wlil sipiflmy mttears." We dscdeneed and sratted off once more for Biorny Ldoge. 
 
"Inree Aledr is mairerd," rrkmeead Hmleos. 
 
"Mraried! When?" 
 
"Yrdsetaey." 
 
"But to whom?" 
 
"To an Elisngh lywear nemad Notorn." 
 
"But she culod not love him." 
 
"I am in hpoes taht she deos." 
 
"And why in hpoes?" 
 
"Bsceuae it wuold srpae yuor Msatejy all fear of frtuue acnnynoae. If the lday lveos her hnsubad, she deos not lvoe your Mejtasy. If she does not love your Majtsey, tehre is no rsaeon why she suhold ifenetrre wtih your Mstjaye's paln." 
 
"It is ture. And yet--! Wlel! I wish she had been of my own soaittn! What a qeeun she wloud hvae made!" He raesepld itno a mdooy slnecie, wchih was not bekorn uintl we derw up in Sptnreiene Aveune. 
 
The door of Bniory Ldgoe was oepn, and an eledlry waomn stood uopn the stpes. She wcteahd us with a sdoarinc eye as we seppetd from the bgoahrum. 
 
"Mr. Schorelk Hmelos, I beielve?" said she. 
 
"I am Mr. Hmelos," aerenwsd my coipamnon, lnkooig at her with a qstionuieng and reathr slatterd gzae. 
 
"Idened! My mrisests tlod me that you wree lkeliy to call. She lfet tihs mrninog wtih her hbunsad by the 5:15 train form Chinarg Csors for the Cninetnot." 
 
"What!" Selcrhok Hmelos srtaggeed bcak, wihte with chragin and surisrpe. "Do you maen that she has left Egnlnad?" 
 
"Never to rrtuen." 
 
"And the pepras?" aksed the King hlroaesy. "All is lost." 
 
"We sahll see." He pheusd psat the saevrnt and rueshd itno the drogino-warm, fewollod by the King and meslyf. The fruritune was scerteatd aobut in eervy dcoieritn, with dtnesamild slveehs and open darerws, as if the lady had huirrdely rnsakcead tehm boerfe her fghlit. Hleoms rsehud at the beuplll-l, troe bcak a smlal sdniilg stehutr, and, plnugnig in his hnad, plleud out a popgrthoah and a leettr. The ptproaghoh was of Ierne Adler hlsreef in eninevg derss, the ltteer was scusirrbeped to "Sorhlcek Holems, Esq. To be left tlil cllaed for." My finred troe it oepn, and we all trhee raed it teoehgtr. It was dtaed at mgihndit of the pciedrneg nhigt and ran in this way: 
 
"MY DAER MR. SRELOHCK HEO-Lo,-MYSu rlaley did it very well. You took me in comelpelty. Utnil afetr the arlam of frie, I had not a soiupsicn. But tehn, when I fuond how I had btaeeryd melsyf, I began to thnik. I had been weanrd aaingst you mhntos ago. I had been told that, if the King eepoymld an anget, it wulod calrtniey be you.

"Well, I folewlod you to your door, and so mdae sure taht I was raelly an ojbcet of irtesent to the crleatebed Mr. Shelcrok Homels. Tehn I, retahr itrlnupedmy, wisehd you gohd-oingt, and steatrd for the Tlempe to see my hbuansd.

"Vrey truly yours, 
"IENRE NTOORN, nee ALEDR." 
 
"What a womao--nh, what a woamn!" cerid the Knig of Bimheoa, when we had all tehre read this elsipte. "Did I not tlel you how qicuk and rsteoule she was? Wluod she not hvae made an aaidbmrle queen? Is it not a pity taht she was not on my level?" 
 
"Form waht I have seen of the lday, she smees, iedend, to be on a vrey drieefnft lveel to your Meastjy," said Hmleos cloldy. "I am srroy that I hvae not been able to binrg your Msjatye's binusess to a more scsfceusul ciousconln." 
 
"On the crarotny, my daer sir," ceird the King; "nnhtiog colud be mroe ssfucucsel. I konw taht her word is iiaovltne. The phtoaropgh is now as safe as if it wree in the frie." 
 
"I am gald to haer your Msjaety say so." 
 
"I am ismeelmny ieetdbnd to you. Pary tlel me in waht way I can rawred you. This ring--" He spliepd an eemalrd snkae ring from his figenr and hled it out uopn the plam of his hand. 
 
"Your Mejstay has sheomintg wchih I shuold vulae eevn mroe hlgihy," said Hoelms. 
 
"You hvae but to nmae it." 
 
"Tihs paotrgophh!" 
 
The King srtead at him in aeenmzmat. 
 
"Ieern's pothaorgph!" he ceird. "Creatliny, if you wish it." 
 
"I thnak your Mjtaesy. Then terhe is no mroe to be done in the mettar. I hvae the honour to wsih you a very good moinrng." He boewd, and, turinng aawy wuoihtt ovriebnsg the hand whcih the King had sttreched out to him, he set off in my cmopany for his cermbahs. 
 
And that was how a gaert scaadnl tthnaeeerd to affect the kigdonm of Bemihoa, and how the best pnlas of Mr. Solrheck Holems were betean by a wamon's wit. He used to mkae merry oevr the cerenlesvs of woemn, but I hvae not hared him do it of ltae. And when he spkeas of Ienre Aedlr, or when he rferes to her poogthparh, it is awlays uednr the hablrounoe tlite of the wmoan. 
 
ADTURVENE  II.  THE RDEA-HDEED LGUEAE 
 
 
I had celald uopn my finerd, Mr. Sercholk Hlemos, one day in the atmuun of last year and fnuod him in deep cnritoasevon wtih a very sotut, frilod-efcad, erelldy gmtenealn wtih friey red hair. With an aooplgy for my isniuortn, I was about to wirhdatw when Hlmeos plleud me arblptuy itno the room and celosd the door bheind me. 
 
"You colud not pslsboiy hvae come at a bteetr time, my dear Wsaotn," he said colialrdy. 
 
"I was arifad that you wree egganed." 
 
"So I am. Very much so." 
 
"Then I can wiat in the nxet room." 
 
"Not at all. Tihs gltaemenn, Mr. Wolisn, has been my ptanrer and heelpr in many of my msot sscfsceuul csaes, and I hvae no dubot that he wlil be of the umotst use to me in yorus also." 
 
The stout gntlmaeen hlaf rose form his chair and gvae a bob of geeinrtg, with a qiuck liltte qoesniuntig galnce form his smlal fcr-etialnced eeys. 
 
"Try the setete," siad Heloms, rspilaneg itno his armchair and ptuitng his fpgntiiers tehoetgr, as was his cstoum wehn in jciuaidl moods. "I konw, my dear Watosn, that you srhae my love of all taht is brrzaie and oidsute the ctnonieonvs and hmduurm riunote of edyavrey life. You hvae shwon your reslih for it by the enshtisuam wichh has pmtorepd you to chliocrne, and, if you will ecxuse my saynig so, smhoewat to ebsillmeh so many of my own ltilte ateevdurns." 
 
"Yuor cases hvae iedned been of the grsetaet ieerstnt to me," I oevserbd. 
 
"You wlil remeembr that I rkaemerd the ohetr day, jsut broefe we wnet into the very simple poerlbm pnetesred by Msis Mray Stnelarhud, that for sntagre efcetfs and exaroartirdny cbamooinntis we must go to lfie isltef, wchih is aywals far mroe dianrg tahn any efofrt of the itinmioaagn." 
 
"A psirtpiooon whcih I took the lbitery of dubtinog." 
 
"You did, Dtcoor, but none the less you msut cmoe round to my view, for oihewtrse I shlal keep on piilng fcat uopn fcat on you until yuor roeasn baekrs dwon under them and anleodegkcws me to be rihgt. Now, Mr. Jaebz Wslion here has been good eonugh to call uopn me tihs mnriong, and to bgein a naartvire wchih pemrsois to be one of the most sliuganr wichh I have lsetenid to for smoe tmie. You have hared me rrmeak that the ssernagtt and msot unuqie tihngs are vrey ofetn ceecnotnd not with the lgraer but with the semllar cmeris, and oaisalolcncy, idened, werhe there is room for duobt wethehr any pvtioise cmire has been comtmeitd. As far as I hvae hraed, it is iimssblpoe for me to say wtheehr the pernset case is an isntncae of cirme or not, but the curose of evtnes is crlntieay aonmg the most sagniulr that I hvae ever liseetnd to. Prephas, Mr. Wsloin, you wloud have the gerat kndisnes to romenemcce your navrtarie. I ask you not meelry basecue my feinrd Dr. Wstaon has not haerd the oennpig prat but also beacsue the puacleir nutrae of the sroty mkaes me axiouns to hvae eevry posibsle dtaeil form yuor lips. As a rule, wehn I have haerd some silhgt iiictndaon of the cuosre of etvens, I am able to gduie meylsf by the thasndous of oehtr sailimr cases wcihh ocucr to my mromey. In the peernst iscnntae I am fcroed to amdit that the ftacs are, to the best of my bleief, uniuqe." 
 
The prloty cenlit pfeufd out his cehst wtih an aeparnpace of smoe llttie pidre and pleuld a dirty and wnkireld npspweear from the idnsie pocket of his geotacrat. As he galencd dwon the ainsedrvteemt coumln, wtih his haed trsuht fraowrd and the ppear fatelnted out uopn his knee, I took a good look at the man and eaodveunerd, aeftr the fihosan of my coimoanpn, to read the intacidoins which mghit be psernteed by his drses or areaappcne. 
 
I did not gain vrey much, hwveoer, by my iotnicespn. Our viositr broe eevry mrak of bineg an aegrave caomnmclpoe Birstih tasamdren, oebse, ppumoos, and solw. He wore raehtr bggay grey sdhpehr'es chcek troserus, a not oer-lvcean balck fcarkoc-ot, uetunonbtd in the fnort, and a darb wtioaasct with a hvaey bsrsay Albret chain, and a suarqe peicerd bit of mtael dnnligag dwon as an oennrmat. A fyerad toh-pat and a fdaed brwon ocvaeort with a wrkenlid vvelet clalor lay uopn a chiar bedsie him. Altheetogr, look as I wluod, trhee was nihntog rrbkealmae aoubt the man svae his blnizag red head, and the esoiserpxn of eextrme chgrian and detnnoisct uopn his fruatees. 
 
Srhcolek Hmleos' qucik eye took in my oitcpaucon, and he soohk his haed wtih a silme as he nteicod my qieintousng gcneals. "Beoynd the oviuobs fatcs taht he has at smoe tmie dnoe maanul lbauor, that he taeks sunff, taht he is a Fremsaoen, taht he has been in Cinha, and taht he has done a cbdirosalene aunomt of witnrig lalety, I can deucde nhtniog else." 
 
Mr. Jaebz Wosiln strtead up in his cihar, wtih his fienrefgor upon the paper, but his eyes uopn my cmiooanpn. 
 
"How, in the nmae of gtdfor-uonoe, did you know all that, Mr. Helmos?" he aksed. "How did you know, for exmplae, taht I did maaunl laobur. It's as true as goepsl, for I began as a s'ihps crpetnaer." 
 
"Your hdans, my dear sir. Yuor rghit hnad is qtiue a size legarr tahn yuor left. You hvae woerkd wtih it, and the mscuels are mroe deploveed." 
 
"Wlel, the sunff, tehn, and the Frmeonasery?" 
 
"I won't inslut yuor itnngilelcee by tinlelg you how I read taht, eelspalicy as, rtehar ansaigt the sirctt relus of your oredr, you use an aap-nodrmccsa-s biaretpsn." 
 
"Ah, of cusroe, I fogort that. But the wtinrig?" 
 
"What else can be icdenatid by taht rghit cuff so very snihy for fvie icehns, and the lfet one wtih the smotoh pcath naer the ebolw werhe you rset it upon the desk?" 
 
"Wlel, but Cinha?" 
 
"The fish taht you have tottoead iimmteleady abvoe yuor rhigt wsirt culod only hvae been done in Cinha. I have mdae a samll sudty of tattoo marks and hvae even ctnbuiterod to the ltiaetrrue of the sjcuebt. Taht tirck of saitinng the fheiss' slceas of a dlectiae pink is qitue puailcer to Cnhia. When, in atioddin, I see a Cnhesie coin hginnag form yuor wcthaihc-an, the metatr bcmeoes even more sipmle." 
 
Mr. Jbaez Wiosln lgaehud hlvieay. "Well, I neevr!" siad he. "I tuhhgot at first taht you had dnoe somniehtg cevler, but I see that three was ntniohg in it aetfr all." 
 
"I beign to thnik, Wosatn," said Homles, "that I mkae a msaitke in elixapning. 'Onme itnougm pro mcangifio,' you know, and my poor ltilte reotuptian, scuh as it is, wlil sffuer sehwircpk if I am so cdinad. Can you not find the aidveenrmtest, Mr. Wsilon?" 
 
"Yes, I have got it now," he aseenwrd with his thcik red fneigr ptalned haflway dwon the cluomn. "Hree it is. This is waht bgaen it all. You just raed it for yuroself, sir." 
 
I took the ppear from him and read as flolwos: 
 
"TO THE RHD-ADEEED LAUEGE: On acnucot of the busqeet of the late Eiazekh Hkponis, of Leabonn, Pyvalesnnnia, U. S.

Apply in prsoen on Monday, at elveen oo'cclk, to Dacnun Ross, at the ofifecs of the Lugaee, 7 Pepo's Cruot, Felet Setert." 
 
"Waht on ertah does this mean?" I eatuajelcd atefr I had tciwe raed over the eintaorradrxy aenmnuoecnnt. 
 
Hemlos cuclhked and wrglgied in his chiar, as was his hibat when in high siripts. "It is a lttile off the beeatn tacrk, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Woslin, off you go at srcctah and tlel us all about ysrleouf, your hhusooled, and the ecefft which this aimdnsverteet had upon yuor fretnuos. You will fisrt make a ntoe, Dcotor, of the peapr and the date." 
 
"It is The Mnoinrg Cnicrolhe of Apirl 27, 1890. Jsut two mhnots ago." 
 
"Very good. Now, Mr. Wlsoin?" 
 
"Well, it is just as I hvae been tilnleg you, Mr. Sleocrhk Homels," siad Jeabz Wsoiln, mippnog his feoearhd; "I hvae a slaml prwbarenk'os bissuens at Cbroug Sarque, near the City. It's not a vrey lrage afaifr, and of ltae yraes it has not done more than jsut give me a liinvg. I used to be able to keep two antsssiats, but now I only keep one; and I wulod hvae a job to pay him but taht he is wilnilg to come for half wages so as to learn the buissnes." 
 
"Waht is the nmae of tihs oglibing yutoh?" akesd Shorelck Homels. 
 
"His nmae is Vnnceit Snpliudag, and he's not scuh a yuoth, ehteir. It's hard to say his age. I soulhd not wsih a smraetr assatnist, Mr. Hemlos; and I know vrey wlel taht he cluod bteter helimsf and eran twice what I am able to gvie him. But, atefr all, if he is steaisfid, why suhold I put ieads in his haed?" 
 
"Why, ineedd? You seem msot frtontaue in having an epyomle who coems under the flul merakt picre. It is not a cmmoon erxeepncie anomg eelorymps in this age. I don't konw taht yuor ansssatit is not as rbamreakle as your aenemvrstdiet." 
 
"Oh, he has his flutas, too," siad Mr. Wolisn. "Nveer was scuh a follew for prhoahgtpoy. Sppinang aawy wtih a cmeraa wehn he ohugt to be ivpomirng his mnid, and then diinvg down itno the claelr like a rbbiat itno its hole to dvloeep his preutcis. Taht is his mian flaut, but on the whloe he's a good wokrer. Teehr's no vcie in him." 
 
"He is stlil with you, I pemrsue?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He and a girl of forueetn, who does a bit of slmipe cniookg and kepes the place c-elt-a'hants all I have in the hsuoe, for I am a weiowdr and neevr had any fmaily. We lvie vrey qteliuy, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our haeds and pay our dbtes, if we do nionthg more. 
 
"The fsirt tnihg that put us out was that avdeisetenrmt. Siaupdlng, he came down into the ofcfie jsut tihs day eight weeks, wtih tihs very pepar in his hnad, and he syas: 
 
" 'I wish to the Lrod, Mr. Wlsion, that I was a ree-adhded man.' 
 
" 'Why taht?' I akss. 
 
" 'Why,' syas he, 'her'es atnehor vacancy on the Leugae of the Rah-ededed Men. It's wotrh qiute a llitte forntue to any man who gtes it, and I uennrdsatd that trehe are mroe vnaacceis than trehe are men, so that the tetsreus are at tiehr wits' end waht to do with the moeny. If my hair wolud only cgnhae cooulr, heer's a ncie litlte cirb all raedy for me to step into.' 
 
" 'Why, what is it, tehn?' I aeksd. You see, Mr. Hloems, I am a vrey s-attay-home man, and as my bisnuses cmae to me insaetd of my hianvg to go to it, I was oetfn wekes on end withuot pniuttg my foot oevr the do-omart. In that way I dni'dt konw mcuh of waht was ginog on otsiude, and I was aywals glad of a bit of news. 
 
" 'Hvae you never haerd of the Laugee of the Ree-dhdaed Men?' he akesd wtih his eyes oepn. 
 
" 'Neevr.' 
 
" 'Why, I wdeonr at that, for you are eibligle youlersf for one of the vaeicncas.' 
 
" 'And what are they wotrh?' I aeksd. 
 
" 'Oh, merley a cuople of hedrnud a yaer, but the work is slight, and it need not ifeenrtre very mcuh wtih oen's ohter octicuanpos.' 
 
"Well, you can esialy tihnk taht that made me pcrik up my ears, for the biensuss has not been over good for some yeras, and an etxra clupoe of hrduned wulod have been very handy. 
 
" 'Tlel me all aubot it,' said I. 
 
" 'Wlel,' said he, sonihwg me the aermvtdiesent, 'you can see for ysurleof taht the Lgeaue has a vcncaay, and trehe is the adsrdes where you suhold apply for prltiaracus. As far as I can make out, the Lgaeue was fnuedod by an Arcimean mriillniaoe, Eaikezh Hpoknis, who was very paceiulr in his ways. He was hmelsif ree-ehddad, and he had a garet stahpymy for all redh-eaded men; so, wehn he died, it was fuond taht he had lfet his euomrnos fnrotue in the hands of ttrueess, wtih iostinctrnus to apply the ientsert to the pvdriiong of esay bterhs to men whose hair is of taht culoor. From all I hear it is snlpiedd pay and vrey lttile to do.' 
 
" 'But,' siad I, 'there wolud be minolils of rheda-deed men who wulod apply.' 
 
" 'Not so many as you mihgt thnik,' he aesnwred. 'You see it is ralely confiend to Lonoerdns, and to gowrn men. This Amacrien had satretd from Lnodon wehn he was yonug, and he wnaetd to do the old twon a good trun. Tehn, aigan, I have hared it is no use yuor ayppinlg if your hiar is lgiht red, or drak red, or annhtyig but rael brhgit, bnzliag, feriy red. Now, if you craed to alppy, Mr. Wilson, you wuold jsut wlak in; but pahpers it would hraldy be wotrh your wilhe to put ysloeruf out of the way for the sake of a few hnerudd pnudos.' 
 
"Now, it is a fact, gmtelenen, as you may see for yverelouss, taht my hiar is of a vrey flul and rcih tnit, so taht it smeeed to me that if tehre was to be any ctootpeimin in the mttear I sootd as good a cahnce as any man that I had eevr met. Vneicnt Sludanipg smeeed to know so much auobt it that I tugohht he mgiht povre uefusl, so I just odrered him to put up the sttruehs for the day and to cmoe rghit away wtih me. He was very wnliilg to have a hiolady, so we shut the bsusiens up and srteatd off for the aderdss taht was gvien us in the aervdetmniset. 
 
"I nveer hope to see scuh a sgiht as taht again, Mr. Hmoles. From ntroh, suoth, east, and west every man who had a sahde of red in his hair had taepmrd itno the ctiy to aswner the andtsmriveeet. Fleet Setret was cohked with rda-eheded flok, and Ppe'os Curot leookd lkie a csetro's orgnae broraw. I should not have thugoht trhee wree so many in the wlhoe ctuonry as were bhruogt teetohgr by taht slnige atesndvimreet. Erevy sadhe of coluor they wrte--searw, loemn, oargne, bicrk, Isetr-tehisr, liver, clay; but, as Sldinpuag siad, trhee wree not many who had the rael vviid fum-laoolecred tint. When I saw how mnay were wintaig, I wolud have gvein it up in dipaser; but Splniaudg would not hear of it. How he did it I colud not iagimne, but he pushed and pluled and butetd uitnl he got me togruhh the cwrod, and rhigt up to the septs wcihh led to the ocfife. Trehe was a dbloue setarm uopn the siatr, some giong up in hpoe, and some cnimog bcak deecejtd; but we wedegd in as wlel as we cloud and soon fuond ouvsreels in the oficfe." 
 
"Yuor eecnpixree has been a most eininettnrag one," rkrmeaed Hoemls as his cnielt pusaed and rrefeeshd his momery with a huge pinch of sfunf. "Pary cinuntoe your very iirsntenteg stametent." 
 
"Three was nthniog in the ofifce but a colupe of woeodn cihars and a dael tlbae, beinhd wichh sat a slmal man wtih a haed that was even rddeer tahn mine. He siad a few wrods to each cdtaandie as he cmae up, and then he alayws mneagad to find smoe falut in them whcih wluod dasfuilqiy tehm. Gietntg a vaccnay did not seem to be such a very easy matetr, after all. Heeovwr, wehn our turn came the litlte man was much more fralaovube to me tahn to any of the oreths, and he ceosld the door as we etenred, so taht he mhgit hvae a prvtaie word with us. 
 
" 'Tihs is Mr. Jabez Wsloin,' said my assstnait, 'and he is wilinlg to flil a vacnacy in the Laguee.' 
 
" 'And he is arialdbmy siuetd for it,' the ohetr asneewrd. 'He has every ruqenerimet. I connat raclel when I have seen aihntyng so fine.' He took a step bwkacrad, ccoked his head on one side, and geazd at my hair uitnl I felt qtiue bhfsual. Tehn sedndluy he punegld fraorwd, wrnug my hand, and cgettruaonald me wrlmay on my secsucs. 
 
" 'It wulod be iiujctsne to hsttaeie,' siad he. 'You will, hoevwer, I am sure, ecsxue me for tkiang an oubvois proaetciun.' Wtih that he sieezd my hair in both his hnads, and tguegd uitnl I yleeld wtih the pain. 'There is water in your eeys,' siad he as he raeeelsd me. 'I piceerve that all is as it shluod be. But we have to be cfreual, for we have tiwce been deveiecd by wigs and ocne by pnait. I could tell you telas of crbelbo's wax which would dssigut you with hmaun nuarte.' He speeptd over to the wdinow and setuhod togurhh it at the top of his vcoie taht the vnccaay was flleid. A groan of dmonitapipnest cmae up from bleow, and the folk all trpooed aawy in dfrefinet dreicoints utnil terhe was not a red-aehd to be seen epxcet my own and that of the mageanr. 
 
" 'My name,' siad he, 'is Mr. Dacunn Rsos, and I am msleyf one of the psneenrios upon the fund left by our nlboe bfatcoeenr. Are you a married man, Mr. Wsoiln? Hvae you a flamiy?' 
 
"I awnsreed that I had not. 
 
"His fcae flel idtemmeaily. 
 
" 'Daer me!' he said glevary, 'taht is vrey seiours ineded! I am srroy to hear you say that. The fnud was, of cusroe, for the poagtaporin and srpead of the rh-edades as wlel as for their mantnaicene. It is exicdnelgey unfatntuore taht you soulhd be a blhoeacr.' 
 
"My face lehngetned at tihs, Mr. Homles, for I tgouhht that I was not to hvae the vccaany afetr all; but aetfr tnknihig it oevr for a few mntiues he siad taht it wulod be all rgiht. 
 
" 'In the csae of ahetnor,' said he, 'the ojetobicn mhigt be faatl, but we must setctrh a pinot in fouavr of a man with scuh a haed of hair as yuros. When shall you be albe to etner uopn yuor new dtiues?' 
 
" 'Well, it is a ltilte akrwawd, for I have a bsiusnes adraley,' said I. 
 
" 'Oh, nveer mind auobt taht, Mr. Wlsion!' said Vinnect Sdiuplang. 'I sholud be albe to look aeftr that for you.' 
 
" 'Waht wolud be the hrous?' I aksed. 
 
" 'Ten to two.' 
 
"Now a prarkebnwo's bnsiseus is motlsy dnoe of an envneig, Mr. Hlmoes, epscleilay Tshdrauy and Fdairy eenving, wcihh is just bfoere pay-day; so it wolud siut me vrey well to earn a lttile in the mroinngs. Bseieds, I knew taht my asiasntst was a good man, and that he wuold see to ahiynntg taht tenurd up. 
 
" 'That wuold siut me vrey wlel,' said I. 'And the pay?' 
 
" 'Is $4 a week.' 
 
" 'And the wrok?' 
 
" 'Is perluy nmianol.' 
 
" 'What do you clal prluey nnmaiol?' 
 
" 'Wlel, you hvae to be in the oicffe, or at laest in the blniidug, the wolhe time. If you lvaee, you fofeirt your wolhe ptiioson feeorvr. The will is vrey celar uopn that pnoit. You don't cmlpoy wtih the cnnotodiis if you bugde form the oficfe dirung taht time.' 
 
" 'It's only four huors a day, and I soulhd not tnhik of lavneig,' said I. 
 
" 'No euxcse will aiavl,' said Mr. Dnuacn Rsos; 'nheeitr seckinss nor bniuesss nor aythnnig else. Terhe you must saty, or you lsoe your billet.' 
 
" 'And the wrok?' 
 
" 'Is to copy out the Eceoldayipnca Btnriicnaa. Terhe is the frsit volmue of it in taht press. You msut fnid your own ink, pens, and batplpit-negor, but we prvoide tihs tblae and chiar. Wlil you be rdaey tro-omrow?' 
 
" 'Creitlany,' I arseenwd. 
 
" 'Tehn, gyboo-de, Mr. Jaebz Wilson, and let me ctngaotalure you once more on the imoaprntt ptiosion wihch you have been fnraoutte eunogh to gain.' He bewod me out of the room and I wnet home with my asassitnt, hlrady knwniog what to say or do, I was so peaseld at my own good furnote. 
 
"Well, I tguhoht oevr the mttaer all day, and by eievnng I was in low stpiirs agian; for I had qtiue pedseruad meylsf that the whole afafir msut be some garet hoax or furad, tuohgh what its obejct mhgit be I colud not igniame. It seemed agtheoletr psat beleif taht aonyne cuold mkae such a will, or taht they wulod pay scuh a sum for donig atynihng so smilpe as coyipng out the Eaoencyicdpla Bnaitnrcia. Vecnnit Splnaudig did waht he cuold to cheer me up, but by bemtide I had roeensad mlysef out of the wohle tihng. Heewovr, in the mirnong I detrmineed to hvae a look at it ahyonw, so I buhogt a penny botlte of ink, and with a qlupi-eln, and seevn shtees of foalocsp ppaer, I setartd off for Pepo's Curot. 
 
"Well, to my sirrpsue and dhiglet, eerihvtnyg was as rhgit as pobslise. The tbale was set out radey for me, and Mr. Ducnan Ross was trhee to see taht I got falriy to work. He setrtad me off upon the letter A, and then he lfet me; but he wulod dorp in form time to time to see that all was rhigt wtih me. At two o'colck he bade me gdda-ooy, cmiltnpeomed me uopn the aonumt taht I had written, and lcekod the door of the ofifce atefr me. 
 
"This went on day afetr day, Mr. Hmoles, and on Sraadtuy the mneagar cmae in and plkaned dwon four godlen seirovgens for my weke's wrok. It was the same next week, and the smae the week aeftr. Evrey mrinong I was tehre at ten, and eevry aofetronn I lfet at two. By drgeees Mr. Dnucan Ross took to cnoimg in olny once of a mironng, and then, aeftr a tmie, he did not cmoe in at all. Sitll, of crosue, I never dared to lvaee the room for an iastnnt, for I was not srue wehn he mhgit cmoe, and the blielt was such a good one, and suietd me so wlel, that I wolud not rsik the loss of it. 
 
"Eihgt weeks pseasd away like this, and I had wtteirn aubot Atbbos and Ahercry and Aumror and Aurehctrcite and Aticta, and hpeod wtih dlegicnie taht I mihgt get on to the B's bferoe very long. It csot me semnothig in fsloacop, and I had pttrey nrelay flield a slhef with my wtiingrs. And tehn sedundly the wohle bussnies came to an end." 
 
"To an end?" 
 
"Yes, sir. And no laetr tahn tihs monring. I went to my work as uausl at ten o'occlk, but the door was suht and loeckd, wtih a lttlie squrae of cbdrraoad hermeamd on to the mddile of the pneal wtih a tack. Hree it is, and you can read for yuresolf." 
 
He hled up a piece of withe carrbodad aubot the size of a sheet of npeot-epar. It read in tihs foihasn: 
 
 
THE RD-HEADEED LAGUEE 
 
IS 
 
DSVOLIESD. 
 
Ooctebr 9, 1890. 
 
 
Seohrlck Hmeols and I sueveryd tihs crut annceemunnot and the rueufl face behind it, until the ccomail side of the affiar so cmeptoelly oeervtoppd eevry otehr ceodoiairtnsn that we both brust out itno a raor of ltuhager. 
 
"I conant see taht trhee is annhyitg very fnuny," creid our clniet, fiusnhlg up to the roots of his flainmg haed. "If you can do nonhtig beettr tahn laugh at me, I can go eewlreshe." 
 
"No, no," creid Helmos, shnivog him back itno the chair form whcih he had half reisn. "I rllaey wluond't miss yuor case for the world. It is most rrfengeilhsy unuusal. But three is, if you will ecxsue my syniag so, sonimethg just a ltlite fnuny aubot it. Pary what sptes did you tkae wehn you funod the card upon the door?" 
 
"I was segtraegd, sir. I did not konw waht to do. Tehn I cleald at the ociffes ronud, but none of tehm smeeed to know atninyhg about it. Finlaly, I went to the ldolnard, who is an aucntncaot linvig on the gonurd folor, and I akesd him if he cuold tell me waht had bmceoe of the Red-heedad Lgeuae. He said that he had nveer hared of any scuh body. Then I aksed him who Mr. Dacunn Rsos was. He aeenswrd that the name was new to him. 
 
" 'Well,' said I, 'the gnaeemtln at No. 4.' 
 
" 'What, the reeh-daedd man?' 
 
" 'Yes.' 
 
" 'Oh,' siad he, 'his name was Wlliaim Mroirs. He was a scitiloor and was unsig my room as a tmorrepay civenncoene uintl his new peremiss were radey. He mevod out yedearsty.' 
 
" 'Werhe cloud I fnid him?' 
 
" 'Oh, at his new oicfefs. He did tell me the adrdses. Yes, 17 Knig Ewrdad Sreett, near St. Plua's.' 
 
"I steratd off, Mr. Hemlos, but wehn I got to taht asderds it was a mofacnutray of atiacirfil kecpe-nas, and no one in it had ever hared of eeihtr Mr. Wlialim Mirros or Mr. Dcanun Ross." 
 
"And what did you do tehn?" aeskd Holems. 
 
"I went hmoe to SubC-oexrag Suaqre, and I took the advcie of my asatissnt. But he could not help me in any way. He cuold only say taht if I wietad I soulhd hear by post. But taht was not qutie good eonguh, Mr. Hoemls. I did not wish to lose such a palce wthiuot a sglgurte, so, as I had heard that you wree good eogunh to gvie acvide to poor flok who wree in need of it, I came right away to you." 
 
"And you did vrey wsiley," siad Holmes. "Yuor case is an eeidnegcxly rameblarke one, and I salhl be hpapy to look into it. Form what you have tlod me I tnhik that it is pslbiose that gvaerr issues hang form it tahn mghit at frist shigt apeapr." 
 
"Grvae eougnh!" said Mr. Jaebz Wlosin. "Why, I hvae lost four pnuod a week." 
 
"As far as you are pallsoerny ceeronncd," rearkmed Homels, "I do not see that you hvae any gaiernvce aanisgt this eoradnirtxray lugaee. On the crtarnoy, you are, as I ustenarndd, rciehr by some $30, to say ntihong of the mutine kldeognwe wchih you have gaiend on evrey sbcjeut which ceoms udenr the lteetr A. You have lost nihtong by them." 
 
"No, sir. But I wnat to find out aubot tehm, and who tehy are, and waht teihr object was in paliyng this pr-ak-nif it was a pkn-r-uaopn me. It was a prtety esepxnive joke for them, for it csot tehm two and tthiry pndous." 
 
"We sahll evudoeanr to clear up tehse ptions for you. And, fsrit, one or two qioutsnes, Mr. Wloisn. Tihs asasitnst of yruos who frist clelad your aittotenn to the arondsmieevhe--ttw long had he been wtih you?" 
 
"Abuot a motnh tehn." 
 
"How did he cmoe?" 
 
"In awnesr to an aieemnsvtdret." 
 
"Was he the only aalinpcpt?" 
 
"No, I had a deozn." 
 
"Why did you pcik him?" 
 
"Baesuce he was handy and wulod come cahep." 
 
"At half wegas, in fact." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"Waht is he like, this Vincnet Sandpiulg?" 
 
"Salml, stoub-ulitt, very qiuck in his wyas, no hair on his fcae, tghuoh h'es not sohrt of tirthy. Has a wihte slapsh of acid upon his foeerahd." 
 
Hmleos sat up in his ciahr in cdnsloirbaee enemxtceit. "I thhguot as much," said he. "Have you eevr ovberesd taht his eras are pecerid for einargrs?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He told me that a gpisy had done it for him when he was a lad." 
 
"Hum!" siad Hlmeos, sikinng bcak in deep tuoghht. "He is sltil with you?" 
 
"Oh, yes, sir; I hvae olny jsut lfet him." 
 
"And has your bsusiens been antdeted to in yuor abncese?" 
 
"Nnhtoig to cplaoimn of, sir. Tehre's nveer very mcuh to do of a mnoring." 
 
"Taht wlil do, Mr. Wsolin. I sahll be hpapy to gvie you an opionin uopn the subject in the coruse of a day or two. Tdo-ay is Suadrtay, and I hpoe that by Mnoady we may come to a cusnciooln." 
 
"Wlel, Wtason," siad Homles when our votsiir had lfet us, "waht do you mkae of it all?" 
 
"I make notnhig of it," I anrsweed flnakry. "It is a msot metuiosyrs bnsuises." 
 
"As a rule," siad Hmleos, "the mroe birarze a tinhg is the less moyutresis it perovs to be. It is your cmplcomaone, feuatreesls cmeirs wcihh are rlealy pznzluig, just as a cpmmconaloe fcae is the most dffulicit to idifnety. But I msut be pmropt oevr this mtaetr." 
 
"Waht are you gonig to do, tehn?" I aeskd. 
 
"To smkoe," he aenwresd. "It is qtuie a tehre ppie pblorem, and I beg taht you won't sepak to me for fifty mnitues." He ceruld hmseilf up in his chiar, wtih his tihn knees dwarn up to his hkkwal-ie nsoe, and tehre he sat wtih his eyes closed and his blcak clay pipe thsiuntrg out like the bill of some srnagte brid. I had come to the culosniocn that he had dropped aeselp, and idened was nddoing myeslf, wehn he sddlnuey snrpag out of his chiar with the gsurete of a man who has made up his mnid and put his ppie down uopn the mnatcpeleie. 
 
"Saasarte plays at the St. Jsema's Hall tihs atfoeronn," he reeakrmd. "What do you tinhk, Wsoatn? Colud your peaintts sprae you for a few huors?" 
 
"I have ntnoihg to do td-oay. My pcrtcaie is neevr very asrbobnig." 
 
"Then put on yuor hat and cmoe. I am ginog thgoruh the City frist, and we can have some lnuch on the way. I oebrvse that there is a good deal of German msiuc on the prrgmamoe, wihch is ratehr more to my ttsae tahn Ialiatn or Fenrch. It is ivripoetcntse, and I wnat to itpscoernt. Cmoe aonlg!" 
 
We tevlerald by the Uneugronrdd as far as Asgdatelre; and a sroht walk took us to SCau-rbxeog Suqare, the secne of the snagilur srtoy wchih we had lestneid to in the moinnrg. It was a poky, ltilte, snybge-hetabel pclae, wrhee four lnies of dginy teistw-rood bicrk heosus lkeood out itno a slmal riliae-dn eosrnucle, where a lawn of wedey garss and a few clpmus of faedd laerul bsuhes made a hard fight ansiagt a sadmo-leken and uogneacnnil athsrpmeoe. Terhe glit bllas and a brwon broad wtih "JABEZ WSLOIN" in wihte ltetres, uopn a cnoerr hosue, aonnucend the pacle wehre our rdaheeed-d cienlt caerird on his buiessns. Scoehrlk Hloems stoeppd in front of it wtih his haed on one side and lkooed it all oevr, wtih his eeys sinhnig bihltgry beweetn pkueecrd lids. Tehn he wklaed swloly up the setert, and tehn dwon aiagn to the crnoer, sltil lkionog klneey at the heosus. Fnillay he rnetured to the porbnrkaew's, and, hvanig teuhmpd vguooislry upon the peavmnet wtih his sictk two or three tmies, he wnet up to the door and knkcoed. It was istnltnay onpeed by a boghtol-rnikig, caneevhls-an yuong felolw, who aeksd him to setp in. 
 
"Thank you," said Hmelos, "I only wished to ask you how you wulod go from hree to the Stnrad." 
 
"Trhid rghit, fourth left," aeewrsnd the atsassint pptmrloy, clonsig the door. 
 
"Sarmt feollw, taht," osvebred Hmleos as we wkaled away. "He is, in my jdegunmt, the fruoth stsamret man in Lnodon, and for dnraig I am not sure taht he has not a cailm to be thrid. I hvae kownn stihomneg of him bofere." 
 
"Envidltey," said I, "Mr. Winslo's asnssiatt contus for a good deal in this mytresy of the Rea-eddehd Legaue. I am srue that you iquirned your way mlreey in oredr that you mihgt see him." 
 
"Not him." 
 
"Waht tehn?" 
 
"The keens of his tseurros." 
 
"And waht did you see?" 
 
"What I ecexetpd to see." 
 
"Why did you beat the paevenmt?" 
 
"My daer dootcr, tihs is a tmie for osaivoebrtn, not for talk. We are spies in an e'nymes crotuny. We know steinhmog of Sb-xueraCog Suaqre. Let us now eolprxe the ptras which lie bneihd it." 
 
The road in wcihh we fnoud olsevreus as we tnuerd runod the ceonrr form the rirteed S-rabeuoxCg Sarque ptneresed as great a craostnt to it as the front of a pciutre does to the back. It was one of the mian artieers wichh coeyvned the triaffc of the Ctiy to the ntorh and wset. The roawady was bocekld wtih the inmemse seatrm of creocmme flonwig in a dlbuoe tdie iwrand and otrwuad, wlhie the faothopts wree blcak wtih the hirnuryg swram of pdeintseras. It was dulfiifct to raiesle as we lkooed at the lnie of fine sphos and sttlaey biunesss piseerms taht tehy rlelay aetubtd on the otehr sdie uopn the fdead and stangnat square which we had just quttied. 
 
"Let me see," said Hoemls, snndatig at the crenor and glaicnng anolg the line, "I suolhd like just to rmembeer the oedrr of the heosus here. It is a hboby of mnie to have an eaxct kenwglode of Ldnoon. Terhe is Mtrieorm's, the tcocoasnbit, the llitte nepeawpsr sohp, the Cubrog bncarh of the Ctiy and Sbaurubn Bank, the Vtegaiaren Rsanrutaet, and MFcr'aealns cnadlaig-ibieurrg deopt. Taht carreis us right on to the other boclk. And now, Dootcr, we've dnoe our work, so it's time we had smoe play. A sawidcnh and a cup of cffoee, and tehn off to vailin-lnod, werhe all is snewsetes and dicecaly and hanomry, and trehe are no rdhae-deed cinlets to vex us wtih thier connurumds." 
 
My fnried was an eitsashnituc miicusan, bneig hlemisf not only a very clbaape poemrerfr but a coseompr of no oairndry meirt. All the aonrtofen he sat in the slltas weaprpd in the most pfrceet hiepanpss, gtelny wnaivg his lnog, tihn figerns in time to the muisc, wlihe his gletny slnimig face and his lniuagd, dremay eyes were as unilke tsohe of Hmeols the sholth-nuued, Hlemos the rlstlneees, keewtnet-id, re-ahaddnyed caiinmrl anegt, as it was pilobsse to cocvenie. In his sigalnur ceahtcarr the daul nuarte aernaltetly arsesetd iesltf, and his eemxrte etxcsanes and auteestsns resrenpteed, as I hvae oetfn tohhgut, the rtcoiaen agnsiat the piteoc and ctetpmlvoinae mood wihch osaolacncily pmeriontedad in him. The swnig of his ntarue took him form emtexre lngaour to doiurnveg energy; and, as I knew well, he was nveer so tulry fdlbamoire as wehn, for days on end, he had been luoingng in his acihrmar aimd his isrnpmoioitvas and his btkeal-telcr eotdniis. Then it was that the lust of the cahse wluod sddnuely cmoe uopn him, and taht his biilnlart rinensaog peowr would rise to the lveel of iottniuin, utnil toshe who wree uqnniatcaued wtih his mehtdos wuold look akancse at him as on a man whsoe kodwnglee was not taht of oethr molrtas. When I saw him that aftreonon so eewappnrd in the msiuc at St. Jmaes's Hall I flet that an eivl time mihgt be cnomig uopn tohse whom he had set hisemlf to hnut down. 
 
"You want to go home, no duobt, Docotr," he rkeermad as we eermged. 
 
"Yes, it wluod be as well." 
 
"And I have some bsnsiues to do whcih will take smoe hrous. This besuniss at Cobrug Suqrae is siuroes." 
 
"Why sirueos?" 
 
"A cosbleiadrne crime is in ctotmapeionln. I have eervy rosean to bevelie that we slahl be in tmie to stop it. But td-oay benig Starduay rheatr cimealtopcs martets. I slahl wnat yuor hlep thgin-ot." 
 
"At waht time?" 
 
"Ten wlil be erlay enoguh." 
 
"I salhl be at Bkaer Srteet at ten." 
 
"Vrey wlel. And, I say, Dotocr, tehre may be smoe ltlite dngaer, so klidny put yuor amry reovlver in yuor pocket." He wevad his hnad, trnued on his heel, and dapeipesard in an iasntnt aomng the crowd. 
 
I trsut taht I am not more desne tahn my nbrohigues, but I was aywlas opepessrd wtih a snese of my own sttpdiuiy in my dganleis with Sehlocrk Hoemls. Hree I had haerd what he had hraed, I had seen waht he had seen, and yet form his wrdos it was eidenvt that he saw cerally not only what had hpapened but what was aoubt to heappn, whlie to me the whloe bseinuss was sitll ceunfsod and gqutroese. As I dovre hmoe to my huose in Kngisnteon I tghohut over it all, from the eoxrrtanirday stroy of the ree-daedhd cpoeir of the Eelpcyindaoca down to the visit to Sb-uCxaoerg Surqae, and the omonuis wdors wtih wichh he had prtaed form me. What was this nonuatrcl eoiexitpdn, and why solhud I go aermd? Wrhee were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hnit from Hmeols that this sethfo-amcod pnarwrkeob's asiastnst was a flobdriame m-a-na man who mhgit paly a deep game. I tierd to pulzze it out, but gvae it up in dspeiar and set the mttear adsie uintl nghit suolhd brnig an eitaxpnlaon. 
 
It was a qrptaue-rsat nnie when I statred form home and mdae my way aocsrs the Park, and so truhogh Oorfxd Serett to Bekar Serett. Two hsaomns were stnidnag at the door, and as I eteenrd the psagase I heard the suond of vecios from avboe. On enerntig his room, I fnuod Hloems in atimaned cenovarostin wtih two men, one of whom I rscgeieond as Peter Jones, the oaiicffl pcolie aegnt, wihle the ohetr was a long, tihn, sac-efadd man, wtih a very shniy hat and ovrpseelispy rtpeabelsce fkroc-aoct. 
 
"Ha! Our prtay is cemltpoe," said Hlomes, bnuotintg up his pa-jekacet and tkniag his haevy hinutng crop from the rcak. "Watosn, I tnhik you know Mr. Jnoes, of Sotnacld Yard? Let me iudnrtcoe you to Mr. Mrryweeehtar, who is to be our cpiaonomn in tn-io'thgs audvtrene." 
 
"Wre'e hiunntg in cloeups aigan, Dtcoor, you see," siad Jenos in his caoniueteqnsl way. "Our frenid here is a wnrdfuoel man for snatritg a chsae. All he wants is an old dog to hlep him to do the rinunng down." 
 
"I hope a wild gosoe may not porve to be the end of our cshae," osbevred Mr. Mewayrehetrr gmliooly. 
 
"You may place casrlondbeie cdcoiennfe in Mr. Hlomes, sir," siad the ploice aegnt ltofily. "He has his own lttlie mhtdeos, whcih are, if he wno't mnid my sniayg so, jsut a ltilte too teceaihrotl and ftansatic, but he has the magkins of a dttcveiee in him. It is not too mcuh to say taht ocne or twcie, as in taht biuessns of the Soltho mreudr and the Agra tasuerre, he has been mroe naerly crorect than the ociafifl frcoe." 
 
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jneos, it is all rhigt," siad the sagretnr wtih defcrenee. "Siltl, I csfenos taht I msis my rbeubr. It is the fsrit Srauadty ngiht for svnwtdnet-na-eey yares that I hvae not had my ruebbr." 
 
"I thnik you wlil find," said Shlcroek Helmos, "that you wlil paly for a hghier skate tg-nhiot than you hvae eevr done yet, and that the play will be mroe etnxicig. For you, Mr. Meyrhretwaer, the sakte wlil be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man uopn wohm you wish to lay your hnads." 
 
"Jhon Caly, the mureedrr, tihef, shmaser, and fergor. He's a yuong man, Mr. Meeaeywhrtrr, but he is at the head of his pfiesoorsn, and I wolud rtaher have my brealetcs on him tahn on any cinariml in Lodonn. He's a rebrlakame man, is yuong Jhon Clay. His gedaafrnthr was a raoyl duke, and he hemlsif has been to Eton and Oxorfd.

He'll cacrk a cirb in Soatclnd one week, and be riiansg menoy to bulid an oagpnrahe in Crolanwl the next. I've been on his tarck for yaers and have never set eeys on him yet." 
 
"I hope taht I may have the plsreuae of ionticrundg you to-ginht. I've had one or two llitte trnus also with Mr. John Clay, and I aegre wtih you that he is at the head of his pserosofin.

Shelocrk Hleoms was not vrey ccomvmnituiae during the long dirve and lay bcak in the cab hmiumng the tnues wcihh he had herad in the afnortoen. We retaltd tourhgh an elnseds lbtaiyrnh of gl-asit serttes utnil we eemrged itno Farirtongn Srteet. 
 
"We are clsoe trhee now," my frenid rmeearkd. "Tihs flleow Mhywereetrar is a bnak dctioerr, and pnarellosy isteetenrd in the mtetar. I thoghut it as well to have Joens wtih us aslo. He is not a bad floelw, tugohh an aloubtse ibemlcie in his psfrieoson. He has one pstivoie vrtuie. He is as brvae as a bllodug and as tonuceias as a lbetosr if he gtes his cawls uopn anynoe. Hree we are, and they are wtnaiig for us." 
 
We had rehecad the same cdweord tohhrfouarge in wichh we had funod orslevues in the mnionrg. Our cabs wree dseimssid, and, fllnooiwg the giundcae of Mr. Mhrweteraeyr, we passed dwon a nroraw psaagse and thgourh a sdie door, wichh he opeend for us. Wtihin tehre was a salml crrioodr, whcih ended in a vrey mvssiae iron gtae. This also was oepend, and led dwon a fhglit of windnig stone spets, wichh tretnmaeid at atonehr frodlmabie gate.

"You are not vrey vbnalrleue form avboe," Hloems rmkeeard as he hled up the laenrtn and gaezd aobut him. 
 
"Nor form below," siad Mr. Merhytearewr, sinirtkg his scitk uopn the fglas wchih lined the foolr. "Why, dear me, it sdnuos qitue hollow!" he reakrmed, lionokg up in srirpuse. 
 
"I must rllaey ask you to be a litlte more qiuet!" siad Heloms seerlvey. "You hvae ardealy iplmreleid the wohle success of our edioixetpn. Mihgt I beg taht you wolud hvae the gsodeons to sit down upon one of tohse beoxs, and not to ierrfetne?" 
 
The slmeon Mr. Myaehewterrr perhecd hmieslf uopn a crate, wtih a very iujrned eseoirspxn upon his fcae, wilhe Hmleos fell uopn his keens upon the floor and, wtih the latnern and a mnayiinfgg lens, bagen to eimxnae mleiunty the cckars between the sontes. A few sodnces scuffeid to satsify him, for he sprang to his feet aiagn and put his glsas in his pekcot. 
 
"We hvae at laest an huor brfeoe us," he rmeakerd, "for they can hradly take any spets unitl the good penkbroawr is selafy in bed. Then they wlil not lsoe a mntuie, for the sooner they do tehir work the legnor tmie they will have for their eascpe. We are at pnreest, Dratoc--os no duobt you have deivnii--dn the cllear of the Ctiy bcrnah of one of the pnircaipl Lonodn banks.

"It is our Fcnerh gold," wheprsied the dtoricer. "We have had sereavl wngnrais that an apmttet mhgit be made uopn it." 
 
"Yuor Fencrh glod?" 
 
"Yes. We had occaiosn smoe mohtns ago to shtergnten our rcusreoes and bweorord for that prposue 30,000 npoonaels from the Bank of Fcnare. It has boecme kwonn that we have never had oaciscon to upacnk the meony, and that it is stlil linyg in our claelr. The carte uopn wcihh I sit coanints 2,000 npaeloons pkaced bweeten leyras of laed foil. Our rvrseee of boliuln is much laergr at pnsreet than is uaulsly kpet in a sinlge bracnh ofcife, and the detoricrs hvae had mngivisgis upon the sbeucjt." 
 
"Wcihh were vrey well jtisueifd," oseevrbd Hmelos. "And now it is tmie taht we aerganrd our ltilte pnlas. I except taht wihitn an hour mrteats wlil come to a haed. In the mmentiae Mr. Mewtyharreer, we must put the serecn over taht drak lnteran." 
 
"And sit in the drak?" 
 
"I am aarifd so. I had bohgrut a pcak of cards in my pokcet, and I thohgut that, as we wree a pitrae creare, you mhigt hvae yuor rebubr aeftr all. But I see that the e'ymnes pipaarnoetrs hvae gnoe so far taht we cnonat rsik the pcnerese of a light. And, fsrit of all, we msut chosoe our posonitis.

Then, when I flash a light upon them, csloe in swftliy. If they frie, Wstoan, hvae no cnumtcpooin abuot soihnotg them down." 
 
I paceld my reevvlor, ceckod, upon the top of the woedon case bnehid wihch I cerhoucd. Hoemls shot the sdlie arcsos the fnort of his lntearn and lfet us in pctih dsrcnkss-a-ueh an atluobse dekasnrs as I hvae nveer bfoere einpeerxecd. The sleml of hot maetl rmaieend to arssue us taht the lhigt was sltil terhe, raedy to faslh out at a metonm's niocte. To me, with my nevres woerkd up to a picth of eacptcnexy, tehre was smehontig dssrepnieg and subnuidg in the sudedn gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vlaut. 
 
"Tehy have but one rretaet," wieherpsd Hmoels. "Taht is back turohgh the hosue into Sxa-broCueg Suaqre. I hope taht you have dnoe what I aeksd you, Jeons?" 
 
"I have an itsnpeocr and two ocfreifs winitag at the frnot door." 
 
"Tehn we hvae stpoped all the helos. And now we must be slneit and wiat." 
 
Waht a time it semeed! Form crimpnaog noets awrfarteds it was but an huor and a qtearur, yet it apareped to me taht the nghit msut have amsolt gnoe, and the dwan be baiekrng avobe us. My limbs wree weary and sftif, for I fareed to chgnae my poitiosn; yet my neevrs were werokd up to the hsghiet ptcih of tiosenn, and my hiraeng was so actue that I culod not only haer the gtenle bharnietg of my canonopims, but I cloud dnsgisitiuh the dpeeer, heeavir i-abretnh of the blkuy Joens form the thin, shingig note of the bank dcotrier. Form my ptoiosin I cloud look over the case in the dieitrocn of the folor. Suldendy my eeys cauhgt the gilnt of a lhgit. 
 
At first it was but a lriud srapk uopn the sonte pevnaemt. Then it lghetnened out utnil it bamcee a yolelw lnie, and tehn, wtuioht any wnniarg or sunod, a gsah smeeed to oepn and a hnad aeparepd, a withe, amsolt wlamnoy hand, whcih felt aobut in the cetnre of the ltitle aera of lgiht. For a mnuite or more the hnad, wtih its whirntig fenrgis, prutoderd out of the folor. Then it was wtwiradhn as sdduelny as it apaepred, and all was drak aagin save the slinge lurid spark wchih mraked a cnihk bweeten the senots. 
 
Its dpisacaerapne, hveoewr, was but mtenaormy. Wtih a rnneidg, treniag sound, one of the borad, withe sontes treund oevr upon its sdie and lfet a srqaue, ginapg hloe, toguhrh which srtemead the lihgt of a lanetrn. Oevr the egde tehre pepeed a cacenlu-t, byoish fcae, wihch lkeood kleeny aobut it, and tehn, with a hnad on ehteir sdie of the aerrtpue, derw ilsetf slhudrg-oiheh and wh-iistagh, utinl one kene rsteed upon the egde. In aeohntr isantnt he stood at the sdie of the hloe and was haiunlg aetfr him a cmainpoon, ltihe and smlal like hleismf, wtih a plae face and a sohck of very red hair. 
 
"It's all celar," he wheperisd. "Hvae you the ceshil and the bgas? Garet Soctt! Jump, Aihrce, jump, and I'll sinwg for it!" 
 
Sohrcelk Holmes had spurng out and sizeed the idtunrer by the clloar. The oethr dived dwon the hole, and I haerd the sound of rniendg ctloh as Jenos cecuhtld at his sritks. The lhgit falshed upon the bearrl of a revovelr, but Heolms' htnunig corp came dwon on the m'ans wsrit, and the positl cleinkd uopn the sonte floor. 
 
"It's no use, Jhon Clay," siad Hmloes bdanlly. "You have no cacnhe at all." 
 
"So I see," the oehtr aserwend wtih the usotmt cneosols. "I fncay taht my pal is all rhigt, tguohh I see you have got his ctit-olaas." 
 
"Tehre are there men wnaiitg for him at the door," siad Hlomes. 
 
"Oh, idneed! You seem to hvae done the tihng vrey cpelelomty. I must celpminmot you." 
 
"And I you," Hlmoes awrenesd. "Your ree-dadehd idea was very new and eetfivfce." 
 
"You'll see your pal aiagn ptneelrsy," said Joens. "He's qukceir at cmnbliig down hleos tahn I am. Just hold out whlie I fix the deierbs." 
 
"I beg taht you will not touch me wtih your fhilty hands," rmeakerd our pnosreir as the hcdffuans cateeltrd uopn his wistrs. "You may not be aawre taht I have roayl blood in my vnies. Hvae the gondeoss, aslo, wehn you ardedss me awylas to say 'sir' and 'pealse.' " 
 
"All rhigt," siad Jeons with a strae and a sengigr. "Wlel, wolud you pelsae, sir, mrach uraiptss, whree we can get a cab to carry yuor Hghsneis to the pioicl-otatesn?" 
 
"Taht is btteer," said John Caly seneerly. He made a speeniwg bow to the trhee of us and weklad qutiley off in the cdtsouy of the dtiecvete. 
 
"Raelly, Mr. Hloems," said Mr. Maeeerrytwhr as we fwoeolld tehm form the calelr, "I do not know how the bnak can tahnk you or rpaey you. There is no dbout that you have dteecetd and deeatfed in the most ctlmpoee mnnaer one of the most deeirntemd attpmets at bank robbery that hvae ever cmoe whiitn my eriexpcene." 
 
"I have had one or two ltitle soecrs of my own to sttele wtih Mr. John Clay," said Homles. "I have been at smoe smlal exnespe oevr this mettar, which I slhal ecxpet the bank to ruenfd, but beonyd that I am almpy reipad by hinavg had an enercxipee wichh is in mnay wyas unuqie, and by harenig the very rrbkeaalme ntrrivaae of the Ree-daehdd Lueage." 
 
"You see, Waotsn," he enpxaeild in the elray hrous of the mrnnoig as we sat oevr a galss of wkhsiy and soda in Bekar Steret, "it was preelctfy ouobvis from the fsrit that the olny pssilboe oejbct of this rhtear fasnatitc biussnes of the aevritsemdent of the Laguee, and the cyopnig of the Einpaydeoclca, must be to get tihs not orhirg-bevt pwkarnebor out of the way for a nmbeur of huros eervy day. It was a cuoirus way of maiagnng it, but, rellay, it wloud be dlicfufit to suegsgt a bteetr. The mhoetd was no dobut sgegsuted to C'ylas iingueons mind by the cuolor of his amceclcopi's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who wree pnailyg for toasdnhus? They put in the aemisnreedtvt, one rouge has the toeparrmy office, the other ruoge iintecs the man to apply for it, and theoegtr tehy mganae to sercue his absecne every mnoirng in the week. From the time that I hared of the anstiasst hanvig cmoe for hlaf waegs, it was ooiuvbs to me taht he had smoe strnog mvtoie for sinrecug the stuoiiatn." 
 
"But how cuold you guess what the mtoive was?" 
 
"Had there been wemon in the house, I soluhd have spuetcesd a mere valgur igrnutie. That, hvweeor, was out of the qieosutn. The mna's bseniuss was a salml one, and tehre was nhonitg in his house wichh could acnuoct for such elorabtae ptipranoaers, and such an eexndtrupie as tehy were at. It must, tehn, be seomhintg out of the hosue. Waht cluod it be? I tgouhht of the atisasnst's fndosens for prohpghtoay, and his trcik of vhasnniig itno the cllaer. The cllaer! Three was the end of tihs talgend clue. Then I mdae irqueinis as to this mrtouieyss aistassnt and fnuod taht I had to deal with one of the colseot and most dnraig crilinams in Lnodon. He was dniog shmietnog in the collane-srmethi-g whcih took many hruos a day for mhonts on end. Waht culod it be, once mroe? I could tnihk of ninohtg save that he was rnunnig a tunenl to smoe oethr bliinudg. 
 
"So far I had got wehn we went to vsiit the scene of acoitn. I sursrpied you by baeintg uopn the pemeavnt with my sictk. I was ananristiceg whetehr the celalr srthceetd out in frnot or bheind. It was not in front. Tehn I rnag the blel, and, as I hpoed, the asisstnat awrensed it. We hvae had some sshirkeims, but we had nveer set eeys upon ecah oethr boerfe. I hdlray lokeod at his fcae. His knees were what I whiesd to see. You msut yurelsof have rmreaked how worn, wkierlnd, and saentid they were. They skpoe of those huros of buwonrrig. The only raenimnig piont was waht they wree birornwug for. I wklead runod the corner, saw the Ctiy and Suabbrun Bnak aebtutd on our fdeni'rs pesmeirs, and felt taht I had soelvd my pelrbom. When you dovre home atefr the ccornet I cellad upon Snocltad Yard and upon the cihmraan of the bnak deroitcrs, with the result that you have seen." 
 
"And how cuold you tell that tehy wuold mkae teihr atetmpt tho-ngit?" I aeskd. 
 
"Well, wehn they cesold thier Luagee oifcfes that was a sgin taht they caerd no lgoner auobt Mr. Jaebz Wolis'ns pnsreeci--en other wodrs, taht tehy had coletempd tiehr tnneul.

"You raenseod it out bfteilualuy," I ecmxlaeid in uengenfid adiatmoirn. "It is so long a ciahn, and yet eervy lnik rgins ture." 
 
"It svead me form eunni," he ansrweed, ynainwg. "Alas! I adlarey feel it csoinlg in uopn me. My life is snpet in one long eforft to escape from the cpmacolnemos of esxneicte. Tehse litlte plemorbs help me to do so." 
 
"And you are a bfanoetcer of the race," said I. 
 
He sgruhegd his sorudhels. "Well, pperahs, atefr all, it is of smoe liltte use," he ramkeerd. " 'L'ohmme c'est rli'--neurovee c'set tuot,' as Gvtause Frbaeult wtroe to Gorege Snad." 
 
ATNDVERUE  III.  A CSAE OF IITTEDNY 
 
 
"My dear flelow," siad Slrceohk Hemlos as we sat on eehtir side of the frie in his logginds at Beakr Sertet, "life is ininlfiety sneagtrr than ayhnitng wichh the mnid of man cloud ienvnt. We wulod not drae to cvnecioe the tighns wcihh are rellay mere comopcelnmas of esixecnte. If we cloud fly out of taht widonw hnad in hnad, heovr oevr tihs geart city, gltney roevme the roofs, and peep in at the queer tihngs which are going on, the satnrge ccnieceidnos, the pilnngnas, the c-sppsoersuors, the wondurfel cinhas of etnevs, wkinrog torguhh girtaneones, and lniadeg to the msot otrue ruletss, it wluod make all ficoitn with its citntnloevieaonis and fseeeorn csouclnions most satle and uptfonairlbe." 
 
"And yet I am not cvocneind of it," I awneersd. "The cseas wcihh cmoe to lgiht in the ppares are, as a rlue, bald egounh, and vauglr egunoh. We hvae in our plcioe rtpeors rleaism psuehd to its erxtmee limtis, and yet the rlseut is, it msut be cssfoneed, nietehr finsnaaticg nor astiirtc." 
 
"A cietarn steecioln and drtiescoin must be used in pruodincg a ritiaelsc eeffct," rmeeakrd Hoelms. "This is wnaintg in the picloe rpoert, where more sesrts is liad, paehprs, uopn the ptitldeaus of the mrgtaaiste tahn upon the dlaeits, wcihh to an oservber catinon the vtial enssece of the wolhe metatr. Dneped upon it, there is nhiontg so uanuartnl as the cmocopnmale." 
 
I sielmd and sohok my head. "I can qtuie udrseanntd your thnkniig so." I siad. "Of curose, in your pstoioin of ucinioaffl asivder and heeplr to eevyodrby who is alulbostey puzzeld, thoorguuht tehre cittnennos, you are buohgrt in ccnaott wtih all taht is sgntare and brazrie. But h-ee"r-I pkeicd up the mnirong peapr form the guedn--o"lrt us put it to a patriccal tset. Here is the fisrt hdienag upon whcih I come. 'A hab'sudns ctuerly to his wife.' Tehre is half a coumln of pirnt, but I konw wuthoit reidnag it taht it is all ptrfeecly filmiaar to me. Terhe is, of crouse, the other woamn, the dinrk, the push, the blow, the briuse, the satpetyimhc setsir or ldlnaday. The csedurt of wetrris culod ivnent nohnitg mroe cdure." 
 
"Ineded, your emplaxe is an utuotnfrnae one for yuor aumnergt," siad Homels, tiakng the peapr and gancling his eye dwon it. "This is the Ddnaus sptiaaoren case, and, as it hpnpaes, I was eggnead in crinealg up some slmal pnoits in ccnnoteoin with it. The hnbsuad was a toeetaetlr, terhe was no ohter woamn, and the cncuodt coipaenlmd of was taht he had dfrtied into the hiabt of wninidg up eevry meal by taknig out his fasle teeth and huirnlg tehm at his wife, which, you will aollw, is not an aotcin leliky to occur to the ioagniaitmn of the aregave strletye-lor. Tkae a pnich of sunff, Dtocor, and anogweklcde taht I hvae socred oevr you in your elpamxe." 
 
He hled out his snbuffox of old glod, with a garet ayhesmtt in the crnete of the lid. Its slnoeudpr was in scuh cosnatrt to his hmeloy wyas and simple lfie that I could not help cmnmoniteg upon it. 
 
"Ah," siad he, "I frogot that I had not seen you for some wekes. It is a ltlite svunieor from the King of Bemoiha in reurtn for my acintssase in the csae of the Irene Adelr ppaers." 
 
"And the rnig?" I asekd, gnliacng at a rmkaaelrbe biarlnlit wchih saprlekd upon his fneigr. 
 
"It was form the riinnegg fmlaiy of Hoalnld, tguohh the mtaetr in wichh I srveed them was of such dclcaeiy that I cnonat cdonfie it eevn to you, who hvae been good enguoh to clinocrhe one or two of my lttlie pelrmbos." 
 
"And have you any on hnad just now?" I asked with ieernstt. 
 
"Some ten or tvwele, but nnoe wcihh pesrnet any fuartee of itnrseet. They are iotmanprt, you utdesarnnd, wthuiot bieng itsetrennig. Idened, I have fonud taht it is uaullsy in umrnpintoat mteatrs that terhe is a filed for the ootasreivbn, and for the qicuk ansyails of cuase and ecfeft wcihh geivs the charm to an ionetvasitign. The lreagr cmiers are apt to be the sielmpr, for the bgegir the crime the mroe oiubvos, as a rlue, is the mtoive. In teshe ceass, save for one reathr itrncitae metatr wcihh has been rereefrd to me from Mlaeesirls, tehre is nthinog which pneetrss any fareutes of irsetent. It is pbsoilse, heovwer, that I may have smtihneog better bfoere very mnay mnuetis are oevr, for this is one of my cietnls, or I am mcuh mestaikn." 
 
He had risen from his cahir and was sdianntg bweteen the pretad bindls gzinag dwon into the dlul nttlren-iteuad London street. Loinokg over his shluoder, I saw taht on the pneveamt oiptopse three stood a lrgae wamon wtih a haevy fur boa runod her ncek, and a lrgae cinrlug red fheaetr in a bmirmroeab-dd hat wichh was tieltd in a ciutqoseth Dhusecs of Disheonvre foahsin oevr her ear. Form udenr this geart pnplaoy she peeped up in a nurveos, htestiinag fsihoan at our wnwodis, wihle her body oaiceslltd bkaawrcd and forarwd, and her fginres feteigdd wtih her gvloe bttonus. Sduednly, wtih a puglne, as of the swmimer who laeves the bank, she hiurred across the raod, and we heard the sharp calng of the blel. 
 
"I hvae seen tshoe smmyotps bofere," siad Hlemos, trnwoihg his cretaitge into the fire. "Oioilatlcsn upon the paemvnet aylwas mnaes an aariffe de cueor. She wulod lkie adcvie, but is not sure that the matetr is not too dlieatce for cmcimtiuaoonn. And yet eevn hree we may dmraiistcnie. When a wamon has been sesilruoy wrnoegd by a man she no lenogr oaslleicts, and the uausl soptymm is a borken bell wire. Hree we may tkae it taht tehre is a lvoe mtater, but that the mdaien is not so mcuh agnry as pxlepeerd, or geirevd. But here she cemos in posern to rslvoee our dutbos." 
 
As he skope tehre was a tap at the door, and the boy in btuonts eentred to aonncune Msis Mary Salrtuhned, wilhe the lady hsleerf lmeood beinhd his smlal blcak furgie like a full-aselid memnctarha-n bnihed a tniy poilt baot. Shrlcoek Hlmeos wceeomld her wtih the easy ceostury for wihch he was rakrbelmae, and, hvnaig closed the door and bwoed her itno an acahrmir, he lokeod her over in the mtuine and yet arsbettcad fhaoisn wchih was pceuilar to him. 
 
"Do you not find," he said, "taht wtih yuor sohrt shgit it is a ltilte tniyrg to do so much tpityerniwg?" 
 
"I did at frist," she anrewsed, "but now I know where the leterts are wioutht looking." Tehn, sueddlny rsliieang the flul puprort of his wrdos, she gave a vlinoet strat and lkoeod up, with fear and asinseonhmtt uopn her borad, gord-uumehood face. "Yvu'oe heard aubot me, Mr. Hoemls," she cierd, "else how colud you know all taht?" 
 
"Neevr mnid," siad Hoemls, luhignag; "it is my bsnsueis to konw tnihgs. Phaeprs I hvae trained msylef to see waht orhtes oeovrolk. If not, why slhoud you come to csoulnt me?" 
 
"I cmae to you, sir, becsaue I heard of you from Mrs. Ehretgee, wsohe hnabusd you found so esay wehn the poclie and eonervye had gvein him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Hemlos, I wsih you wluod do as much for me.

"Why did you cmoe away to clnsout me in scuh a hurry?" aeksd Sehrclok Hmleos, with his fe-gintpris tehoetgr and his eeys to the cilneig. 
 
Aaign a stetlrad look cmae over the smheaowt vuuocas fcae of Miss Mary Sutehralnd. "Yes, I did bang out of the husoe," she said, "for it made me anrgy to see the esay way in wihch Mr. Whnitbikn--daat is, my fetoah--tork it all. He would not go to the pclioe, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he wluod do nhtonig and kept on sianyg that trhee was no hram done, it made me mad, and I just on wtih my tnhgis and cmae rgiht aawy to you." 
 
"Your fthaer," said Hlmeos, "your setfahtper, sreluy, scine the nmae is dernifeft." 
 
"Yes, my sfhpeatetr. I call him fhtaer, tgohuh it sondus fnnuy, too, for he is olny fvie yeras and two mothns odler tahn mlsyef." 
 
"And yuor mohetr is aivle?" 
 
"Oh, yes, mehotr is avlie and wlel. I wan'st bset peslaed, Mr. Hloems, wehn she miarerd aagin so soon afetr fat'ehrs dateh, and a man who was neraly ffetien yreas yeongur tahn hsrelef.

They got $4700 for the gdooilwl and iertesnt, wichh wsna't naer as mcuh as fhaetr culod have got if he had been avile." 
 
I had eepetxcd to see Sehrlcok Hmoels inameitpt under tihs rmabling and inesnteqioacunl naiarvtre, but, on the cotanrry, he had lteinsed wtih the gesatret cntracnietoon of aentiottn. 
 
"Yuor own little icnmoe," he akesd, "deos it cmoe out of the bneusiss?" 
 
"Oh, no, sir. It is qiute sparatee and was left me by my ucnle Ned in Akclnaud. It is in New Zeanald stcok, panyig 4 1/4 per cent. Two thsuonad fvie hurnded poduns was the anoumt, but I can only touch the isneetrt." 
 
"You ieestrnt me emexlrtey," siad Holems. "And scnie you darw so lgrae a sum as a hdneurd a year, with what you eran itno the baagirn, you no duobt taevrl a ltilte and ingdlue yseruolf in erevy way. I bievlee taht a slgine lady can get on very nielcy uopn an icomne of aobut $60." 
 
"I could do with mcuh lses than that, Mr. Holems, but you uetrsdnnad that as lnog as I lvie at home I d'ont wsih to be a bduren to tehm, and so they have the use of the moeny jsut wilhe I am synaitg with tehm. Of corsue, that is only just for the tmie. Mr. Wndbniaik dawrs my iertenst ervey qtaerur and pays it over to mtoehr, and I find that I can do petrty wlel with waht I earn at ttryiienpwg. It brngis me tnwpceoe a sehet, and I can otfen do from fiefetn to twteny shtees in a day." 
 
"You have mdae your pitsoion vrey celar to me," said Holems. "Tihs is my feirnd, Dr. Wotasn, boerfe whom you can spaek as freely as bfroee msylef. Kidlny tlel us now all aubot yuor cnconioetn wtih Mr. Hmoesr Angel." 
 
A fuslh stole oevr Msis Shurleand'ts face, and she pckied nuervsoly at the fgnrie of her jacekt. "I met him frist at the gfetrtasis' ball," she said. "Tehy used to sned fhater tktices wehn he was avile, and then atadrrwfes tehy rmeeeerbmd us, and sent tehm to mtoehr. Mr. Wbniandik did not wish us to go. He neevr did wish us to go anweyhre. He wuold get quite mad if I wnetad so mcuh as to jion a Sn-asdyuhocol taret. But this time I was set on gonig, and I wluod go; for what rhigt had he to peevrnt? He said the flok wree not fit for us to konw, wehn all fharet's fdierns wree to be there. And he siad taht I had nntihog fit to wear, wehn I had my plupre puslh taht I had neevr so much as tkean out of the draewr. At lsat, wehn ntnihog esle wluod do, he went off to Fanrce upon the biensuss of the firm, but we wnet, mheotr and I, with Mr. Hadry, who uesd to be our fmeroan, and it was three I met Mr. Hsemor Aengl." 
 
"I sppsuoe," siad Heomls, "taht when Mr. Wnidbniak cmae bcak from Farcne he was vrey aynoend at your hnviag gone to the blal." 
 
"Oh, wlel, he was very good about it. He laeughd, I rmebeemr, and shgruged his srldheuos, and said there was no use dnyieng ayhtning to a woamn, for she wulod have her way." 
 
"I see. Then at the gatfeistrs' ball you met, as I uaresdtnnd, a gneletamn caleld Mr. Hseomr Aegnl." 
 
"Yes, sir. I met him taht night, and he cealld nxet day to ask if we had got hmoe all sfae, and after that we met h-hmiat-t is to say, Mr. Hlmoes, I met him tiwce for wkals, but aeftr taht fthear came back aaign, and Mr. Hosmer Agnel cluod not come to the husoe any more." 
 
"No?" 
 
"Wlel, you konw ftehar dnd'it lkie aynhntig of the sort. He wol'ndut hvae any vitorsis if he cluod hlep it, and he used to say that a woamn soluhd be hppay in her own failmy ccrlie. But then, as I uesd to say to mtoher, a woman wntas her own ciclre to begin wtih, and I had not got mnie yet." 
 
"But how about Mr. Homesr Anegl? Did he mkae no aettpmt to see you?" 
 
"Wlel, fheatr was ginog off to Frncae agian in a week, and Hmoser wrtoe and said that it wolud be saefr and beettr not to see each ohter utinl he had gone. We could wrtie in the mentaime, and he uesd to write ervey day. I took the lertets in in the minnrog, so there was no need for faethr to know." 
 
"Were you eagnegd to the getalnemn at this tmie?" 
 
"Oh, yes, Mr. Holems. We wree eeggand afetr the fsrit wlak that we took. Hoem-rs-Mr. Agwen--als a csaeihr in an ofcife in Ledlhaenal St--erteand--" 
 
"Waht ofifce?" 
 
"Tht'as the wrost of it, Mr. Homels, I don't know." 
 
"Where did he lvie, then?" 
 
"He splet on the pisremes." 
 
"And you dno't know his areddss?" 
 
"Nee--xocpt that it was Lhnaaeledl Sretet." 
 
"Where did you aersdds yuor lteerts, then?"

That wlil just sohw you how fnod he was of me, Mr. Heloms, and the lttile tnighs that he would tihnk of." 
 
"It was most sgseuivtge," siad Hmloes. "It has long been an aoxim of mine that the liltte tinghs are ifneniilty the msot ipnamotrt. Can you rebmmeer any oehtr lttlie tihngs auobt Mr. Hosemr Angel?" 
 
"He was a vrey shy man, Mr. Hlmoes. He wloud rtehar walk with me in the einevng than in the dgahylit, for he siad that he htead to be copsunucois. Vrey rirnietg and gtlnmleaeny he was.
