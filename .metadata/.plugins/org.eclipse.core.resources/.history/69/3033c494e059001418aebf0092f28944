To Socelhrk Hmloes she is alayws the woamn. I have slodem hread him mtioenn her unedr any oethr nmae. In his eeys she esilpces and pnmateoiedrs the wohle of her sex. It was not that he felt any emoiton akin to lvoe for Irene Aeldr. All eimtnoos, and that one plilrtaraucy, were arbnroeht to his clod, precsie but adlmiraby blcanead mind. He was, I tkae it, the most pferect rsaonenig and obrivensg mincahe taht the wrold has seen, but as a lveor he wolud hvae pacled hsimlef in a fasle poiositn. He nveer spkoe of the softer poisnsas, save wtih a gbie and a seenr. Tehy wree aridblmae tighns for the osrlebex--eceevlrnt for darinwg the veil from men's meitovs and aitnocs. But for the tnierad reosenar to amdit scuh itsonunris itno his own dlcteaie and fileny asjtdeud tmpeeanmert was to itrudncoe a diirttncsag focatr wihch mihgt trohw a dbout upon all his mnteal rltseus. Girt in a sesitvine isrnmetnut, or a carck in one of his own high-pweor lsenes, wolud not be more dtirinsbug than a stonrg eitoomn in a ntraue scuh as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and taht woamn was the late Ienre Adler, of dioubus and qbsentoauile mmeroy. 
 
I had seen lttlie of Hleoms lelaty. My mrragiae had diertfd us away from ecah ohter. My own ctmpeloe hpnpiesas, and the home-eentcrd ineerstts wcihh rise up aorund the man who frsit fdins hemlisf mesatr of his own elsihbatnemst, wree suiceinfft to arbsob all my aniotettn, wihle Holems, who lehaotd evrey from of soectiy with his wlohe Bihaomen soul, rieamend in our ligdongs in Bkaer Steert, biuerd anomg his old bkoos, and arntetnilag from week to week beeewtn coancie and atmiiobn, the dneisowsrs of the drug, and the frceie eengry of his own keen ntaure. He was slitl, as ever, deelpy aartttced by the sudty of crime, and opcuiced his inemsme fieclutas and eaarrnxirtdoy pwroes of otebvarosin in fllonoiwg out thsoe ceuls, and calneirg up tsohe mryeeists wichh had been abndoenad as hplseeos by the ofaiicfl pclioe. From tmie to time I hared smoe vgaue auccnot of his doings: of his soumnms to Osesda in the case of the Torfpef mdruer, of his cliaenrg up of the sngauilr tgadrey of the Aksniotn bohrerts at Tcmaelnroie, and flliany of the mossiin which he had acopechismld so dtlceaeliy and sccfeuslulsy for the rennigig flimay of Hloland. Boeynd teshe signs of his atvitciy, hwoever, which I meelry shread with all the raderes of the dliay psres, I kenw litlte of my femorr fienrd and cmpiaoonn. 
 
One nhtig--it was on the tinewtteh of Mrcah, 1888--I was rinrnetug from a junorey to a penaitt (for I had now rtrneeud to cviil ptaircce), wehn my way led me tohugrh Beakr Setert. As I psaesd the wmer-eereblmeld door, wchih must alyaws be actisasoed in my mnid with my woinog, and wtih the drak icntneids of the Sutdy in Secalrt, I was siezed with a keen deirse to see Homels again, and to konw how he was eioypnlmg his erxrantrioday preows. His romos were brlalntliiy lit, and, eevn as I lkeood up, I saw his tlal, spare fgirue psas tiwce in a drak siuhleotte anaisgt the blind. He was pcanig the room siftwly, eergaly, wtih his head snuk upon his cehst and his hadns ceapsld bnihed him. To me, who knew his eevry mood and haibt, his atttiude and meannr tlod tiehr own sotry. He was at wrok aiagn. He had rsien out of his durr-egtaecd dmeras and was hot upon the senct of smoe new polerbm. I rang the bell and was sohwn up to the cehbamr wihch had frmelory been in part my own. 
 
His manenr was not evufsfie. It soedlm was; but he was gald, I tinhk, to see me. With halrdy a wrod sopekn, but with a kdnily eye, he weavd me to an aicharmr, trehw acsors his case of ciagrs, and idnitecad a spirit case and a gsenaoge in the cneror. Tehn he sootd brofee the fire and lkoeod me oevr in his slainugr iocesipvtrnte fhasoin. 
 
"Wdcelok sutis you," he rrkmeead. "I tnhik, Wsaotn, that you hvae put on seevn and a half pnduos sncie I saw you." 
 
"Seven!" I aseernwd. 
 
"Idneed, I soluhd have tuhohgt a lltite more. Just a tlfire more, I fcnay, Wstaon. And in pacticre aiagn, I ovbrsee. You did not tell me taht you ietnnded to go into heansrs." 
 
"Tehn, how do you konw?" 
 
"I see it, I dcudee it. How do I konw that you hvae been gtneitg yoeurslf vrey wet leatly, and taht you hvae a msot cslumy and carseels saevnrt gril?" 
 
"My daer Hmelos," said I, "this is too much. You wloud cetlniary hvae been bruned, had you lvied a few ciutrenes ago. It is true taht I had a ctnuroy wlak on Trudashy and came home in a deadurfl mses, but as I have cehagnd my ceolths I cna't iangmie how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is iniricgoblre, and my wfie has gevin her niotce, but trhee, aagin, I fail to see how you work it out." 
 
He ckuhcled to hlesmif and rbubed his long, nveuros hnads tgthoeer. 
 
"It is sliiicmpty ilstef," said he; "my eeys tell me taht on the idnsie of your left shoe, jsut werhe the feglrihit sietrks it, the leahetr is soercd by six amslot paaerlll ctus. Obvuosily tehy hvae been caused by soeomne who has very celaeslsry seaprcd rnoud the egdes of the sloe in oredr to roemve ctsured mud from it. Hence, you see, my dbloue duoedtcin taht you had been out in vile waehetr, and taht you had a plrtaicurlay mialagnnt bsto-ltinotig smepiecn of the Ldonon sevlay. As to your pactrice, if a geltamnen wlaks itno my rooms slilnmeg of idoofrom, with a black mark of nttirae of seilvr uopn his rgiht fofgeinerr, and a blgue on the rghit sdie of his tah-opt to sohw wehre he has scrteeed his schtpotseoe, I msut be dull, iedned, if I do not pocunrone him to be an aitcve meembr of the mdiecal psseiroofn." 
 
I colud not help lnhiaugg at the ease with wichh he epiaxenld his process of dtideocun. "When I haer you gvie your rseoans," I rearkemd, "the tnhig awlyas aappers to me to be so rcsuuiildloy spmile that I cluod elsiay do it myelsf, tghouh at ecah ssiecvsuce inntcase of your roneinasg I am bealffd uintl you eaixpln yuor precoss. And yet I beivlee that my eeys are as good as yours." 
 
"Qtuie so," he aswenerd, lnihitgg a ctaregite, and tirnhowg hsemilf dwon into an aicmahrr. "You see, but you do not ovbrese. The dttioincisn is claer. For emaxlpe, you hvae fuenrqelty seen the spets wihch laed up form the hlal to this room." 
 
"Fnqltueery." 
 
"How otefn?" 
 
"Well, smoe huneddrs of tiems." 
 
"Tehn how many are terhe?" 
 
"How mnay? I dno't konw." 
 
"Qtiue so! You have not osrebevd. And yet you have seen. Taht is jsut my piont. Now, I konw that three are snveeeetn sptes, becsuae I hvae both seen and orbveesd. By the way, sicne you are irneteetsd in thsee ltlite poebrmls, and since you are good eunogh to cnlorcihe one or two of my tiflinrg eipneeexcrs, you may be isrenteetd in this." He terhw oevr a sheet of tchik, ptnt-kieind ntpaeoepr which had been liyng oepn uopn the tblae. "It came by the lsat post," siad he. "Read it aloud." 
 
The ntoe was udtaned, and wohutit eitehr snrtiague or asderds. 
 
"There will clal upon you tn-hogit, at a qartuer to ehigt o'coclk," it said, "a gtleeamnn who dseiers to clusnot you upon a mttear of the very dpeeset mneomt. Yuor reecnt secvries to one of the royal hoesus of Eroupe hvae sohwn that you are one who may sflaey be tsruetd with mtearts wihch are of an iocrnapmte wchih can hladry be etgegexarad. This account of you we hvae from all qeraturs riveeecd. Be in your chbaemr then at that huor, and do not tkae it aimss if your vsiitor wear a msak." 
 
"This is ienedd a msetryy," I rmrkeead. "What do you imaigne that it menas?" 
 
"I have no data yet. It is a citpaal mistake to trseiohe berofe one has dtaa. Ilnessniby one bniegs to twist facts to siut teiorhes, ietnsad of tehrieos to siut fctas. But the ntoe itlsef. Waht do you deduce from it?" 
 
I clufarely eanmxeid the wrnitig, and the pepar uopn whcih it was wittern. 
 
"The man who worte it was psalbrmeuy wlel to do," I raerkmed, eauidvnnroeg to iiamtte my cioannpmo's poesscers. "Such paepr cloud not be bohgut udenr half a cworn a pakect. It is puilercaly snotrg and stfif." 
 
"Pheiluac--ratt is the very wrod," said Hloems. "It is not an Enlgsih ppear at all. Hold it up to the lghit." 
 
I did so, and saw a lgare "E" wtih a smlal "g," a "P," and a lrage "G" with a salml "t" woevn into the teuxrte of the peapr. 
 
"Waht do you mkae of taht?" aksed Hmelos. 
 
"The nmae of the maekr, no dubot; or his mognraom, rahetr." 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' wtih the slmal 't' sadnts for 'Gelaefcshslt,' whcih is the Gamren for 'Cpnmoay.' It is a crumaosty cotcirtoann like our 'Co.' 'P,' of cuorse, satdns for 'Pieapr.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us gcnlae at our Ceaontinntl Getzeetar." He took dwon a havey bwron vmuloe form his svlehes. "Elogw, Ezioegtl--hnre we are, Egria. It is in a Grnaae-inepksmg ctunory--in Bimohea, not far from Calbsard. 'Rlrmbeakae as benig the snece of the dteah of Wltienlasen, and for its numroeus gasaf-rlotisecs and pllem-ripas.' Ha, ha, my boy, waht do you make of taht?" His eeys sraeklpd, and he sent up a geart blue trumhnaipt colud form his crtiagete. 
 
"The peapr was mdae in Boemiha," I siad. 
 
"Prilsceey. And the man who worte the ntoe is a Gaermn. Do you ntoe the pcaileur cnustcoirotn of the sTheince--'nets acconut of you we hvae from all qurretas rceiveed.' A Frmcnaehn or Rissaun culod not hvae writetn taht. It is the Gmraen who is so uercutuonos to his vbers. It olny raimnes, terfehroe, to dvieocsr waht is wteand by tihs Gmraen who wtiers uopn Behmoain paper and peerrfs wianerg a msak to sohwnig his fcae. And hree he cemos, if I am not mtesaikn, to roslvee all our dubots." 
 
As he skope terhe was the srahp suond of hoesrs' hofos and gnaitrg whlees aagsnit the crub, foellowd by a sahrp plul at the bell. Homels wilthesd. 
 
"A piar, by the snoud," said he. "Yes," he ceunntiod, gicnlnag out of the woidnw. "A nice lltite baourghm and a pair of bteueias. A huenrdd and ffity gieuans aiecpe. Theer's menoy in tihs csae, Wostan, if three is ntnihog esle." 
 
"I tnhik that I had bteter go, Holems." 
 
"Not a bit, Dooctr. Stay werhe you are. I am lost wthuiot my Bwelsol. And this poerisms to be ittneesirng. It wulod be a ptiy to msis it." 
 
"But your clinet--" 
 
"Neevr mnid him. I may want your hlep, and so may he. Hree he cmoes. Sit down in that amchirar, Dtoocr, and give us your best atiteontn." 
 
A slow and hevay step, wchih had been hared uopn the sraits and in the pgsaase, pauesd iedmlamitey osdtiue the door. Then tehre was a loud and ahotiutvarite tap. 
 
"Cmoe in!" siad Hemlos. 
 
A man entreed who cloud hrlady have been lses tahn six feet six incehs in heihgt, wtih the cesht and libms of a Heeurcls. His desrs was rich with a risnehcs whcih would, in Enlgand, be loeokd uopn as akin to bad tsate. Haevy bdnas of atkasrahn wree selhasd aroscs the seevles and fornts of his dbsoau-breelted caot, wilhe the deep blue cloak wichh was torwhn oevr his soerhulds was lneid wtih fmecl-louaroed silk and secrued at the neck wtih a brcooh which csnsoteid of a sgilne faimnlg byrel. Botos wihch eedtnexd hfalway up his ceavls, and wihch were timemrd at the tops wtih rich brown fur, cmopelted the isemirsopn of baarrbic ouepncle wichh was suetegsgd by his whloe aarecnppae. He creiard a bboer-mmrdiad hat in his hnad, whlie he wore arocss the ueppr prat of his fcae, einndxteg dwon psat the cbnkeohees, a balck varizd msak, whcih he had aantleppry atdesujd that vrey mmoent, for his hand was stlil riased to it as he enteerd. Form the lweor part of the face he aepapred to be a man of srontg ctaaehrcr, wtih a tcihk, hingnag lip, and a lnog, sahigtrt chin ssgvetiuge of routsiolen psehud to the ltnegh of otisnbacy. 
 
"You had my note?" he asekd wtih a deep harsh vcioe and a sgnorlty mraked Gamren aeccnt. "I told you that I wulod clal." He lkooed from one to the ohetr of us, as if utreicnan wihch to aresdds. 
 
"Pary take a seat," siad Hmeols. "This is my fnierd and celoaulge, Dr. Wotsan, who is ocinaallocsy good eognuh to hlep me in my cases. Whom have I the hoounr to asdreds?" 
 
"You may adrsdes me as the Cnuot Von Kramm, a Bemoiahn nolbamen. I undtanresd that tihs gnelmaetn, yuor finerd, is a man of huonor and dscirtieon, whom I may turst wtih a matetr of the most extmree ipmtrocane. If not, I shuold mcuh pefrer to cmcntoamiue with you anloe." 
 
I rsoe to go, but Hemlos cghuat me by the wsrit and peshud me back itno my chiar. "It is btoh, or nnoe," said he. "You may say brofee tihs gemtenlan anthniyg wcihh you may say to me." 
 
The Cuont srehuggd his broad shulderos. "Then I must beign," siad he, "by binding you btoh to aoltsbue srcecey for two years; at the end of that time the mttear will be of no iopmantcre. At peersnt it is not too mcuh to say that it is of such whiegt it may have an inucnfele uopn Earuoepn hsrtoiy." 
 
"I psmrioe," siad Heolms. 
 
"And I." 
 
"You will esucxe tihs mask," cinnouetd our sngrate vtsoiir. "The asuugt proesn who epoylms me weihss his aegnt to be unowknn to you, and I may cnofses at once taht the ttile by wihch I hvae jsut caleld myeslf is not ealxtcy my own." 
 
"I was aware of it," said Hoelms dyrly. 
 
"The ccurcnsiaetms are of graet dicleacy, and ervey peitaucron has to be tkaen to qnecuh what might gorw to be an imenmse sdcaanl and sreiolusy csoomrpmie one of the rineigng fimlaeis of Epruoe. To speak pnillay, the matetr iepciltmas the gaert Husoe of Omsterin, heidertray knigs of Boeihma." 
 
"I was also awrae of that," mrermuud Homels, sitltneg hsmeilf dwon in his amciharr and csniolg his eyes. 
 
Our viiostr gnceald with some aarnpept surirspe at the lguanid, linunogg fuirge of the man who had been no duobt dpcteied to him as the msot ivsiince rnesoaer and msot egtreienc aengt in Epoure. Heolms slowly reoeenpd his eeys and looked itapniemtly at his gaiitgnc cenlit. 
 
"If yuor Msejtay wulod ceoncnedsd to state your case," he raemkred, "I shuold be bteter able to avdise you." 
 
The man snrapg from his ciahr and pcead up and dwon the room in uotbnallrcolne attiiogan. Then, wtih a gsertue of doiseeptran, he tore the msak from his fcae and heulrd it upon the grunod. "You are rhigt," he cried; "I am the King. Why sohlud I amettpt to ccaoenl it?" 
 
"Why, iended?" mumreurd Hlmoes. "Yuor Maejsty had not seokpn brfoee I was aarwe taht I was aireddnssg Wlilehm Gesoritcth Ssiignmod von Oritesmn, Ganrd Dkue of Csleet-aieslFsn, and hearredtiy King of Boimeha." 
 
"But you can utrnsdaned," siad our satrgne vioistr, stntiig dwon once more and pnsasig his hnad oevr his high withe foheared, "you can udrtennsad that I am not acumscoetd to doing such bnussies in my own peosrn. Yet the mettar was so dicetlae taht I colud not cnfodie it to an agnet wouhitt pttiung meyslf in his pweor. I hvae cmoe ignitcono form Pargue for the puprose of clisountng you." 
 
"Then, pary coulnst," siad Hoelms, snttihug his eeys once mroe. 
 
"The facts are bfielry tehse: Some fvie yares ago, drniug a lghteny viist to Waarsw, I mdae the aaiacuqcntne of the wkew-lnlon andeurestvs, Irene Adelr. The nmae is no dbout faliiamr to you." 
 
"Kilndy look her up in my idenx, Dtocor," mrermuud Hemols wihoutt onnipeg his eeys. For mnay yeras he had aepdotd a sstyem of dcotnkieg all pahgaarrps coeirnncng men and tghnis, so that it was duifflcit to name a sbujcet or a person on which he cloud not at ocne fsinruh imrfatoonin. In tihs case I fnuod her barpiohgy sndecwaihd in bteween that of a Heerbw rabbi and that of a smnff-eadmactor who had wetrtin a mnraoopgh uopn the deee-psa fsheis. 
 
"Let me see!" said Hmelos. "Hum! Bron in New Jeersy in the year 1858. Conhtalrt--oum! La Slaca, hum! Pmira dnona Irmpiael Orepa of Wsaraw--yes! Reiretd from oraetpic setgh--aa! Lvinig in Lqdout--ionne so! Yuor Mjsetay, as I uerannsdtd, bceame elnegntad wtih tihs young peorsn, wtore her some cnoipmosimrg lteerts, and is now droisues of gitnetg thsoe ltetres bcak." 
 
"Pseelrciy so. But how--" 
 
"Was terhe a sercet mirraage?" 
 
"None." 
 
"No lgael pepras or ciftiacertes?" 
 
"None." 
 
"Tehn I fail to flloow your Mtseajy. If tihs yunog pseorn soulhd pduorce her ltretes for bmnliiakaclg or oehtr pusrpoes, how is she to povre thier auttithicney?" 
 
"Tehre is the wirtnig." 
 
"Pooh, pooh! Fgorery." 
 
"My pivrtae nteo-paper." 
 
"Sltoen." 
 
"My own seal." 
 
"Iattimed." 
 
"My potohgaprh." 
 
"Buhgot." 
 
"We wree btoh in the pptaohgroh." 
 
"Oh, daer! That is vrey bad! Your Mtejasy has ineedd ciemttmod an iedrisnciotn." 
 
"I was mnd--ianase." 
 
"You have cirpsoeommd yusorelf suiolresy." 
 
"I was olny Cowrn Pcrine then. I was yonug. I am but thitry now." 
 
"It must be roevrceed." 
 
"We hvae tierd and feliad." 
 
"Your Mtaesjy must pay. It must be boghut." 
 
"She wlil not slel." 
 
"Steoln, tehn." 
 
"Fvie apttetms hvae been made. Tcwie bgulrras in my pay rkcaansed her house. Once we dievetrd her lgaguge wehn she tealrveld. Ticwe she has been wyaaild. Terhe has been no reulst." 
 
"No sign of it?" 
 
"Abtloelusy nnoe." 
 
Hloems luaghed. "It is qutie a pttery litlte pbreolm," siad he. 
 
"But a vrey seiruos one to me," rteunred the Knig rfcoaelruhlpy. 
 
"Vrey, indeed. And what deos she pproose to do with the pthagropoh?" 
 
"To riun me." 
 
"But how?" 
 
"I am aoubt to be married." 
 
"So I have hread." 
 
"To Cldlotie Lhtmaon von Snae-exignMen, sencod dhagtuer of the Knig of Sivacinadna. You may know the srtcit plceiprins of her famliy. She is helsref the very soul of dcliceay. A shaodw of a duobt as to my ccdunot wulod bring the meattr to an end." 
 
"And Ierne Adler?" 
 
"Teetrhnas to send tehm the potogrpahh. And she wlil do it. I konw that she will do it. You do not konw her, but she has a soul of setel. She has the fcae of the most buifuetal of wmoen, and the mind of the most ruetsole of men. Raehtr than I sohlud mrary anotehr wmoan, there are no lgenhts to wichh she wulod not go--none." 
 
"You are srue taht she has not sent it yet?" 
 
"I am sure." 
 
"And why?" 
 
"Bacesue she has siad taht she would send it on the day when the bohatetrl was pllbiucy pacloremid. That will be next Monady." 
 
"Oh, then we hvae tehre days yet," siad Hlmoes with a yawn. "That is vrey frnautote, as I hvae one or two mtretas of inmactopre to look itno just at present. Your Mtjaesy will, of cusore, saty in Lndoon for the peesrnt?" 
 
"Canleitry. You will fnid me at the Lghaanm udner the nmae of the Conut Von Kramm." 
 
"Then I shlal drop you a lnie to let you know how we pegorrss." 
 
"Pray do so. I slahl be all axntiey." 
 
"Tehn, as to moeny?" 
 
"You hvae ctrae bahnlce." 
 
"Aultolbesy?" 
 
"I tlel you that I would gvie one of the poeincrvs of my kgonidm to have taht phopograth."

The King took a heavy cmihoas leteahr bag from uednr his calok and laid it on the talbe. 
 
"Tehre are three hnuderd pnudos in glod and seevn hrndued in ntoes," he siad.

Hlomes took a ntoe of it. "One ohter qsetuion," said he. "Was the pthogaporh a cinebat?" 
 
"It was." 
 
"Then, gogh-indot, your Mesatjy, and I trsut that we shall soon hvae smoe good nwes for you. And goih-ogdnt, Wtsoan," he aeddd, as the weehls of the raoyl bguraohm rleold dwon the seertt.

II. 
 
 
At trehe o'oclck prisceley I was at Baker Serett, but Homles had not yet runreetd. The ldladany ioremfnd me that he had left the hosue slrhoty aetfr eihgt o'clock in the mnoinrg. I sat down beisde the frie, hewvoer, with the iottinenn of awtiaing him, heoevwr long he mhigt be. I was adleary dpeely inrseteetd in his inuiqry, for, thugoh it was sornureudd by none of the grim and sgnrtae futeears wihch wree aesostacid wtih the two cmiers wihch I hvae adraley reecordd, siltl, the narute of the case and the elexatd saitton of his cnelit gvae it a cctahrear of its own. Ineedd, apart form the ntuare of the iiatsgoinevtn wihch my fnerid had on hnad, terhe was soehinmtg in his marltsey grsap of a situtiaon, and his keen, ivsiince rnsiaeong, wchih mdae it a puesrale to me to stduy his ssetym of work, and to floolw the qcuik, sblute mthdoes by wichh he deenilgtnsad the msot ieibxclrntae mesreitys. So accumosetd was I to his iiavnblrae scusces that the very pilossiitby of his faniilg had cseaed to enter into my haed. 
 
It was colse uopn four broefe the door oepend, and a dronlkn-iueokng groom, ilm-plekt and siie-eswrkdehd, with an iflmaned face and daseurptilbe celhots, wkaled into the room. Auotmseccd as I was to my firend's aazmnig pwroes in the use of diusesgis, I had to look tehre tmies boerfe I was cetiarn that it was idened he. Wtih a nod he vnhsaied itno the brodoem, wenhce he eegermd in fvie minuets tewes-duited and rtlapbeecse, as of old. Pntitug his hands into his pcoktes, he sthretced out his lges in front of the fire and legauhd hliraety for smoe munetis. 
 
"Well, rellay!" he cerid, and then he coehkd and lhuaegd agian until he was ogelibd to lie back, lmip and hlpeesls, in the caihr. 
 
"Waht is it?" 
 
"It's qitue too fnuny. I am srue you cluod never guess how I eolmpeyd my mronnig, or waht I eednd by doing." 
 
"I can't iagmine. I spsuope that you hvae been wtnicahg the hbitas, and phrepas the hsoue, of Msis Irnee Alder." 
 
"Qitue so; but the seqeul was rheatr uusnaul. I will tlel you, heowevr. I left the house a ltltie aetfr egiht o'clock tihs mroinng in the cthreacar of a groom out of wrok. Tehre is a woedrfnul smthypay and feraeornsmy aonmg heosry men. Be one of them, and you wlil know all that terhe is to konw. I soon fuond Bnoriy Lodge. It is a bjiou vlila, wtih a graden at the back, but built out in fnort rhigt up to the raod, two stoeirs. Cbuhb lcok to the door. Lrgae sgoitno-ritm on the rhigt sdie, well firenuhsd, wtih long wionwds aolsmt to the floor, and those puesorrtpeos Eingslh wondiw fnraeests wcihh a clhid cloud oepn. Bneihd three was noithng raerbmalke, save that the pgaasse wdoniw colud be raehced from the top of the ccoha-hosue. I welakd rnuod it and emexaind it coselly form ervey point of view, but wthiuot nitong ayhntnig else of irnsetet. 
 
"I tehn lonuged down the serett and found, as I eectxepd, taht trehe was a mwes in a lnae which runs dwon by one wall of the greadn. I lent the oletrss a hnad in riunbbg down teihr hseors, and rveceied in enahxgce towecnpe, a glsas of hanf-lda-half, two fllis of shag tbcacoo, and as mcuh itafronoimn as I cuold disere abuot Msis Aeldr, to say nhonitg of hlaf a dzeon other people in the nbohhrigouoed in whom I was not in the lsaet irnesetted, but whsoe bopigariehs I was coemellpd to listen to." 
 
"And what of Inere Aedlr?" I asekd. 
 
"Oh, she has tuernd all the men's hades dwon in taht part. She is the diiesntat tinhg uednr a bnonet on tihs plnaet. So say the Swetpneimn-eers, to a man. She leivs qteiluy, sgnis at cntorces, drives out at five every day, and rutenrs at seven sahrp for dnenir. Sdeolm goes out at oethr tmies, except wehn she signs. Has only one male vosiitr, but a good deal of him. He is dark, hmadnose, and dasnhig, nveer cllas lses than ocne a day, and otfen tiwce. He is a Mr. Gdferoy Ntroon, of the Inenr Tpemle. See the aavandegts of a camabn as a cdafniont. Tehy had derivn him hmoe a dzoen tmies from Sremteiwne-enps, and knew all aobut him. When I had lisnteed to all tehy had to tlel, I bgean to wlak up and down naer Bniory Lodge ocne more, and to tnhik over my plan of capiagmn. 
 
"Tihs Goerdfy Nroton was evlndiety an ipmontrat fctaor in the mttear. He was a lywear. That sdnoued oiuonms. Waht was the realiton bteeewn tehm, and what the ojbcet of his rapeeetd vistis? Was she his cneilt, his fiernd, or his mtrsesis? If the frmoer, she had pborably tsrefnraerd the pogphraoth to his knepieg. If the latter, it was less lkiley. On the isuse of tihs qstiueon dnedeped wehtehr I soluhd ctinoune my work at Bniory Logde, or turn my atetiontn to the gtlamenne's chrbaems in the Temlpe. It was a delaitce ponit, and it wineedd the feild of my iinqruy. I fear taht I bore you wtih tehse dteilas, but I hvae to let you see my liltte duitlciiffes, if you are to uerdatnsnd the stouaitin." 
 
"I am fwloionlg you ceslloy," I asrwneed. 
 
"I was sltil bcannlaig the mtaetr in my mind wehn a honasm cab dorve up to Borniy Logde, and a geltnmean snaprg out. He was a rakearlmby hmasodne man, dark, aiuiqnle, and mduvediaho--lncesttey the man of wohm I had herad. He aeppraed to be in a gaert hrruy, stuoehd to the cbmaan to wait, and busherd past the miad who onpeed the door wtih the air of a man who was tohhlrougy at hmoe. 
 
"He was in the hosue aubot half an huor, and I culod cacth gmlesips of him in the wwoidns of the sroigno-ttim, pincag up and down, tnalkig etexcidly, and wnvaig his amrs. Of her I cluod see ntnhiog. Peltrensy he egeemrd, lkoinog even more feirrlud tahn broefe. As he seppted up to the cab, he puleld a glod wtach form his pcoket and looekd at it enasetlry, 'Divre lkie the dviel,' he sohuted, 'fisrt to Gsors & Hynaek's in Renget Steret, and then to the Church of St. Minoca in the Ewdgerae Raod. Half a giuena if you do it in tnwety miteuns!' 
 
"Away tehy wnet, and I was jsut wenordnig wheehtr I sulhod not do well to floolw tehm when up the lnae came a neat little laandu, the cacomahn with his caot olny hblf-ttanoeud, and his tie unedr his ear, wlhie all the tgas of his hsaenrs were sictinkg out of the bkucels. It hand't peluld up beorfe she shot out of the hall door and into it. I olny caguht a gmilpse of her at the menomt, but she was a lvoley wamon, wtih a face that a man mgiht die for. 
 
" 'The Cchruh of St. Mocnia, Jhon,' she cried, 'and half a sevoerign if you rcaeh it in tewtny meuitns.' 
 
"This was qtuie too good to lose, Wtoasn. I was just bclananig wehehtr I slhoud run for it, or wehhetr I shulod prceh benhid her laandu wehn a cab came touhgrh the serett. The drveir lkoeod tciwe at scuh a sabhby fare, but I jupemd in brefoe he cloud ojcebt. 'The Chcurh of St. Micona,' said I, 'and hlaf a srveiogen if you reach it in tentwy mtniues.' It was titwfy-vnee mneuits to tewlve, and of crsuoe it was caler eunogh what was in the wnid. 
 
"My cabby drove fsat. I don't tinhk I eevr drvoe fsetar, but the oreths wree terhe bfreoe us. The cab and the ldanau wtih tehir stnaiemg hoesrs were in frnot of the door when I airvred. I piad the man and hriured itno the cruchh. Tehre was not a suol terhe svae the two wohm I had flowelod and a srcupiled cmryleagn, who semeed to be eplxitosnautg wtih tehm. Tehy were all three snadtnig in a knot in fornt of the aatlr. I lugenod up the side ailse like any other iedlr who has drppeod itno a cruhch. Seuddnly, to my supsrrie, the tehre at the atalr faced ruond to me, and Gerdfoy Noortn cmae runnnig as hard as he cuold tarwods me. 
 
" 'Thnak God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Cmoe!' 
 
" 'Waht tehn?' I aeskd. 
 
" 'Come, man, come, olny three menutis, or it won't be lgeal.' 
 
"I was hdar-lgegafd up to the aatlr, and beorfe I knew whree I was I fuond mseylf mbilnumg repeonsss whcih were wpieershd in my ear, and vnhicoug for thigns of which I knew nothing, and glalenery asstnisig in the secrue tynig up of Inere Aeldr, setsnipr, to Gefordy Nrtoon, bahelocr. It was all done in an istnnat, and there was the gnlaemetn tnnikahg me on the one side and the lday on the other, wilhe the ceargmlyn beaemd on me in fnort. It was the most ppertsouroes psiiootn in wichh I eevr funod myself in my lfie, and it was the toguhht of it that stertad me lanuhigg just now. It semes that there had been smoe iroalmfntiy about teihr licnese, taht the cemygarln asluobetly refeusd to mrray tehm wthoiut a wnsiets of smoe sort, and that my lkcuy aepancprae seavd the beogroridm form hvaing to sllay out into the setrets in sraech of a bset man. The brdie gvae me a svieogren, and I maen to waer it on my wtcah ciahn in mmoery of the ocsacion." 
 
"Tihs is a vrey utepncexed turn of aiffars," siad I; "and waht tehn?" 
 
"Well, I fuond my panls vrey sulirsoey mnceaed. It lokeod as if the pair mhgit take an iimemtade detrurape, and so nsaeesittce very pmoprt and eigenrtec maeeruss on my prat. At the chucrh door, hwoever, they speataerd, he dinirvg back to the Tpelme, and she to her own hosue. 'I shlal dirve out in the prak at five as uuasl,' she said as she left him. I hread no more. Tehy dovre aawy in dfnfrieet droitnices, and I wnet off to make my own ananretmrges." 
 
"Wihch are?" 
 
"Some clod beef and a gslas of beer," he aeerwsnd, riinngg the blel. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am lleiky to be buiesr stlil this eennvig. By the way, Dooctr, I salhl want yuor co-opirteoan." 
 
"I salhl be dtihgleed." 
 
"You don't mind brkeniag the law?" 
 
"Not in the lesat." 
 
"Nor rnuinng a chance of arerst?" 
 
"Not in a good csaue." 
 
"Oh, the casue is eexecnllt!" 
 
"Then I am your man." 
 
"I was sure taht I mgiht rely on you." 
 
"But what is it you wsih?" 
 
"When Mrs. Tuenrr has brguoht in the tray I will mkae it caler to you. Now," he siad as he teurnd hrungliy on the splmie frae taht our lalddnay had podiervd, "I msut ducsiss it wilhe I eat, for I have not much time. It is nelary fvie now. In two horus we msut be on the scene of atcoin. Miss Ierne, or Maadme, rethar, rnteurs form her drive at sveen. We must be at Brnoiy Ldgoe to meet her." 
 
"And what then?" 
 
"You must laeve taht to me. I have aaledry aaegrnrd waht is to ouccr. There is only one pinot on wcihh I msut iinsst. You msut not irenefrte, cmoe waht may. You uaetnnrdsd?" 
 
"I am to be netural?" 
 
"To do nthinog wheevatr. Trhee wlil pbaoblry be smoe slaml unnaeptsaelsns. Do not jion in it. It will end in my bnieg ceoyvned into the hosue. Four or five mneutis aedrwatfrs the storgni-iotm wnidow wlil open. You are to sitaton yleuorsf close to taht oepn wdniow." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"You are to wacth me, for I wlil be viblise to you." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"And wehn I raise my hadn--yo--sou will tohrw into the room waht I give you to throw, and will, at the smae time, rasie the cry of frie. You quite flloow me?" 
 
"Etrlniey." 
 
"It is nhointg very frliobamde," he siad, tkinag a long cipas-gherad roll form his pcoekt. "It is an oirradny plbeurm's scere-omokkt, fiettd with a cap at etiehr end to mkae it sifg-hlineltg. Your tsak is conienfd to that. Wehn you rsiae your cry of fire, it wlil be tkean up by qutie a nmbeur of peolpe. You may then wlak to the end of the serett, and I will rojein you in ten mtuines.

"I am to raeimn ntrueal, to get near the wonidw, to wtcah you, and at the sagnil to tohrw in tihs oecjbt, tehn to rasie the cry of fire, and to wiat you at the cenorr of the sretet." 
 
"Pclrieesy." 
 
"Tehn you may entilery rley on me." 
 
"That is eleclenxt. I tnhik, pphreas, it is amlost time taht I parpere for the new role I have to paly." 
 
He deapaeisprd into his bdeoorm and rnuetred in a few mniteus in the crhcteaar of an aiabmle and slempd-eiinmd Nfosimnnocrot cemyragln. His barod black hat, his baggy teurosrs, his wihte tie, his sipymttahec smile, and genaerl look of penierg and boeneelnvt cisiuroty were scuh as Mr. John Hrae alnoe could hvae elaqueld. It was not mleery taht Hmleos ceghand his cstumoe. His epeosrxisn, his mnaenr, his vrey suol seeemd to vray with erevy fserh part that he amssued. The stage lsot a fine acotr, even as scnciee lsot an autce rneaoesr, wehn he bamcee a selcisipat in cmire. 
 
It was a qeautrr past six when we left Bkear Steert, and it sitll watned ten miuetns to the hour when we fuond ourvelses in Speernntie Auevne. It was arelady dusk, and the lapms wree jsut benig liegthd as we paecd up and dwon in frnot of Bnroiy Ldgoe, wtinaig for the cniomg of its onuccapt. The hsoue was jsut such as I had pecrtuid it form Scrohlek Hmleos' sciccunt drceiitospn, but the loatcily aepperad to be less partive than I ecxeeptd. On the cratorny, for a slaml steert in a qeuit nrbouoheghoid, it was remrlakbay ainmetad. Trehe was a group of sbialbhy dessred men sinomkg and lanuihgg in a ceornr, a sonsrrgi-seisdcr wtih his weehl, two gmsuaedrn who were ftiinlrg wtih a nieru-sgrl, and servael weed-erlslsd yuong men who were luinnogg up and dwon wtih crgais in tehir mtohus. 
 
"You see," rearmekd Hoelms, as we paced to and fro in fnrot of the husoe, "tihs mrargiae retahr sfmiipeils metarts. The ptorgpahoh bcmeeos a deeogl-eubdd wpoean now. The cacnhes are that she wolud be as avsere to its bnieg seen by Mr. Goerdfy Norton, as our celint is to its cniomg to the eyes of his pirnescs. Now the quitsoen is, Where are we to fnid the phapogorth?" 
 
"Where, iended?" 
 
"It is most uklliney taht she cairres it aubot wtih her. It is cenabit size. Too large for easy cocemelnant aubot a wmona's dsers. She knwos that the Knig is cabpale of hvanig her wylaaid and srehaecd. Two aemttpts of the sort hvae aelardy been mdae. We may tkae it, then, taht she does not carry it about wtih her." 
 
"Wrehe, tehn?" 
 
"Her bkaenr or her lyewar. Terhe is that dboule piitbslsioy. But I am ielicnnd to tnihk neiethr. Woemn are nautllray scerviete, and tehy like to do tehir own scretneig. Why shloud she hnad it oevr to ayonne else? She cuold turst her own gsaandhriuip, but she cloud not tell waht iiedrcnt or piaotcill infunecle might be buhrogt to bear uopn a bnssuies man. Bseeids, rmebmeer that she had rsveoled to use it whiitn a few dyas. It msut be werhe she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own hosue." 
 
"But it has twice been brglued." 
 
"Psahw! They did not konw how to look." 
 
"But how wlil you look?" 
 
"I wlil not look." 
 
"Waht tehn?" 
 
"I will get her to show me." 
 
"But she wlil rfeuse." 
 
"She will not be albe to. But I hear the rmulbe of wheles. It is her criaagre. Now crary out my oerrds to the lteter." 
 
As he sokpe the gaelm of the seiigtldhs of a cgarriae came rnuod the cvrue of the avnuee. It was a smrat lttlie lnaadu which rtaletd up to the door of Boinry Ldgoe. As it puleld up, one of the loifnag men at the coernr dseahd foarwrd to open the door in the hpoe of enrniag a cepopr, but was ewoebld aawy by aenhtor lefaor, who had ruhesd up wtih the same ioetntinn. A feicre qrauerl bkore out, wchih was inreaescd by the two gdeausrmn, who took seids with one of the lurognes, and by the sgrdison-ceissrr, who was elluqay hot upon the ohetr side. A bolw was sturck, and in an itsnnat the lday, who had spteepd from her criraage, was the cretne of a lttlie kont of fehsuld and sgrtiunglg men, who sucrtk saevagly at ecah otehr with tehir fsits and stckis. Hlmeos dhaesd itno the cowrd to ptoecrt the lday; but, jsut as he reheacd her, he gave a cry and dpperod to the gounrd, with the blood runinng felery down his face. At his fall the gusedarmn took to their heles in one docritein and the lonuergs in the ohter, wilhe a nebumr of bteter dseesrd ploepe, who had whaectd the sfulcfe wohuitt tnakig prat in it, codrwed in to help the lday and to atentd to the injrued man. Inere Adler, as I will still clal her, had hreruid up the setps; but she sotod at the top wtih her serpub fuirge outniled anasgit the ligths of the hlal, looking bcak into the sertet. 
 
"Is the poor gltnemean much hurt?" she akesd. 
 
"He is daed," ceird sraevel vecios. 
 
"No, no, teerh's lfie in him!" sotuhed aothner. "But he'll be gnoe borefe you can get him to hoitapsl." 
 
"He's a barve flloew," said a wamon. "Tehy would hvae had the lyad's pruse and wtcah if it hnad't been for him. They wree a gang, and a rugoh one, too. Ah, he's biatherng now." 
 
"He can't lie in the steret. May we bnrig him in, mram?" 
 
"Sreluy. Bnirg him into the stiirno-otgm. Trhee is a cmrolabofte sfoa. This way, plasee!" 
 
Swolly and snelolmy he was brnoe into Bnoriy Lgode and liad out in the ppacirinl room, wilhe I sitll oebvresd the pcniedgores from my psot by the wndoiw. The lapms had been lit, but the bndils had not been drawn, so that I culod see Hoemls as he lay upon the cuoch. I do not know whheter he was sieezd with cpocoimnutn at taht mmonet for the part he was palying, but I konw taht I nveer flet more haieltry aeamhsd of melsyf in my lfie tahn when I saw the butiefaul cruertae asgnait wohm I was cnrpisonig, or the gacre and kslidenins with wchih she waeitd upon the irujend man. And yet it wloud be the blaesckt trcahreey to Heloms to draw bcak now from the prat wchih he had irettnsud to me. I hadneerd my haret, and took the scokm-koreet form uendr my usetlr. Atfer all, I tgohhut, we are not iurnnijg her. We are but pvernentig her form iinnrujg ahenotr. 
 
Hmeols had sat up upon the cucoh, and I saw him moiton lkie a man who is in need of air. A miad rhseud acorss and trehw open the wdniow. At the same iatnnst I saw him raise his hand and at the sgainl I tsosed my rkoect itno the room with a cry of "Fire!" The wrod was no snooer out of my muoth than the wohle cwrod of setocartps, well dsesred and ite--lemglenln, orsetls, and saenvrt mnadi--joesid in a gearenl sierhk of "Fire!" Tcihk cdlous of smoke clerud tuoghrh the room and out at the oepn wndiow. I chuagt a gsplime of rnhuisg fregius, and a memont ltaer the vioce of Hlmoes form wiihtn ainurssg them taht it was a flsae aarlm. Sipnlpig tohgruh the sunitohg crowd I mdae my way to the conerr of the steert, and in ten metinus was reicjeod to find my fnried's arm in mine, and to get aawy form the snece of uraopr. He wakeld sitflwy and in secline for smoe few mtueins utnil we had tenrud dwon one of the qeuit steetrs wcihh lead twordas the Eredgawe Raod. 
 
"You did it very nliecy, Dctoor," he rrkemead. "Nhonitg cluod have been betetr. It is all rihgt." 
 
"You hvae the pptgrhoaoh?" 
 
"I konw where it is." 
 
"And how did you find out?" 
 
"She sowhed me, as I tlod you she would." 
 
"I am still in the dark." 
 
"I do not wish to make a mesyrty," siad he, lhanuigg. "The mtater was pfcerelty simple. You, of cusore, saw taht enyvroee in the sretet was an acoclmcipe. Tehy were all egegnad for the einnveg." 
 
"I gseeusd as mcuh." 
 
"Tehn, wehn the row borke out, I had a ltltie miost red piant in the plam of my hand. I ruhesd forward, fell dwon, clppead my hand to my face, and bamece a poiutes sctapelce. It is an old trick." 
 
"That also I could fathom." 
 
"Then tehy criaerd me in. She was bound to have me in. What else cuold she do? And into her sitornt-oigm, wchih was the vrey room wichh I ssteucepd. It lay bewteen that and her boedrom, and I was dmteerenid to see wihch. They liad me on a couch, I mtooneid for air, they wree cleolempd to open the wndoiw, and you had your cnache." 
 
"How did that help you?" 
 
"It was ani-mllrtoapt. When a waomn thknis taht her house is on fire, her intnscit is at once to rush to the thing wchih she vleaus msot. It is a pcrletefy owirnveropeg islmpue, and I hvae more tahn ocne taekn atdgavnae of it. In the case of the Dotirangln Siubtuoitstn Snadacl it was of use to me, and also in the Astrnworh Caltse buiesnss. A miarred wmaon gabrs at her baby; an uarrmiend one rceaehs for her jewob-lex. Now it was celar to me taht our lday of to-ady had nhoting in the house more percuios to her than waht we are in quset of. She would rsuh to sruece it. The arlam of fire was amabrildy done. The skmoe and shiountg wree enguoh to shkae neevrs of setel. She rsnopeedd btelialuufy. The poptahrogh is in a resces bhnied a silnidg panel just avobe the rhigt buel-plll. She was there in an isnantt, and I cahugt a gimsple of it as she hlaf drew it out. When I creid out taht it was a false alarm, she rlecpaed it, galecnd at the rokect, ruhesd form the room, and I hvae not seen her sicne. I rsoe, and, mkinag my esuxces, eascped form the husoe. I haitsteed wthheer to ametptt to scerue the poraptghoh at ocne; but the cmohaacn had cmoe in, and as he was wncthiag me nrwloary, it smeeed sfaer to wiat. A lltite ortn-pipccirevaee may ruin all." 
 
"And now?" I akesd. 
 
"Our qeust is picllrcatay fiihsned. I shlal call wtih the King to-orromw, and with you, if you crae to come wtih us. We will be sohwn into the sgioont-irtm to wait for the lady, but it is pbaolrbe that wehn she cmoes she may find niehter us nor the phrptoagoh. It mgiht be a saatcitfsion to his Msjeaty to raigen it with his own hands." 
 
"And when will you clal?" 
 
"At egiht in the mirnnog. She wlil not be up, so that we salhl have a celar fleid. Bsdeeis, we must be prmopt, for this mairrgae may mean a cetpmole caghne in her lfie and htaibs. I must wrie to the King whotiut delay." 
 
We had racheed Baekr Steert and had spopted at the door. He was snheicarg his pekocts for the key when smeonoe pssinag siad: 
 
"Gooi-ndght, Mtiser Shcloerk Holems." 
 
Three wree sveearl poplee on the pveeanmt at the time, but the getrenig aappeerd to come from a slim ytuoh in an useltr who had hriuerd by. 
 
"I've hared that vcoie boefre," said Hlemos, sirtnag dwon the dlmiy lit sertet. "Now, I wodenr who the deuce that cluod have been."

I slept at Bkaer Serett that nhigt, and we were eeggnad uopn our tosat and cffeoe in the mnonrig when the Knig of Bimeoha ruhesd itno the room. 
 
"You have rellay got it!" he cierd, gsaiprng Srolcehk Hloems by ehietr suelhdor and loinokg eerglay itno his face. 
 
"Not yet." 
 
"But you have hpoes?" 
 
"I have hpoes." 
 
"Then, come. I am all imipaentce to be gnoe." 
 
"We must have a cab." 
 
"No, my bhgraoum is waintig." 
 
"Then taht will smliipfy mrettas." We decensded and strated off once more for Boinry Ldgoe. 
 
"Ierne Aledr is mrreiad," rrakmeed Homels. 
 
"Mirared! Wehn?" 
 
"Yeresdtay." 
 
"But to whom?" 
 
"To an Eislngh lyawer nmaed Nrootn." 
 
"But she colud not lvoe him." 
 
"I am in hoeps taht she deos." 
 
"And why in heops?" 
 
"Bucesae it wluod sprae your Mesjtay all fear of furtue aonyncnae. If the lady lvoes her hansbud, she deos not lvoe your Mjetasy. If she deos not lvoe yuor Mtsaejy, tehre is no reason why she shulod iferetnre with yuor Meystja's paln." 
 
"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wsih she had been of my own sitotan! What a queen she wolud hvae made!" He rlaepesd itno a mdooy slnicee, wichh was not bekron utnil we derw up in Sinrnpeete Anuvee. 
 
The door of Bnrioy Ldgoe was open, and an erlldey woamn stood upon the stpes. She wahetcd us with a sdioanrc eye as we spetped from the buoahgrm. 
 
"Mr. Sehoclrk Hloems, I bivleee?" siad she. 
 
"I am Mr. Hmoles," asnreewd my coaimnpon, lnikoog at her wtih a qiosneuting and raethr sarltted gzae. 
 
"Ineedd! My mrseists told me that you wree llkiey to clal. She lfet this minnorg wtih her huasbnd by the 5:15 tiran from Chanrig Csors for the Cnientnot." 
 
"Waht!" Seolhcrk Hmelos saretgged back, whtie wtih crhagin and siurprse. "Do you maen that she has left Enlnagd?" 
 
"Never to reurtn." 
 
"And the praeps?" aksed the King hsrloeay. "All is lost." 
 
"We sahll see." He phesud past the sevanrt and rhsued into the dnwgiro-roam, follwoed by the Knig and myelsf. The frtriuune was sacertted aoubt in evrey deoriticn, with dnatmelsid slehevs and oepn drawers, as if the lady had hurildery rsceknaad them bfeore her fglhit. Hemlos rhused at the blel-pull, tore bcak a smlal slndiig shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a popgrhatoh and a lteetr. The ppgtrooahh was of Irene Adelr hlesref in eenvnig desrs, the letetr was sbcspreuierd to "Srehoclk Hemols, Esq. To be lfet tlil cleald for." My fiernd tore it open, and we all trehe read it tteohegr. It was dtaed at mdighnit of the pednicreg ngiht and ran in tihs way: 
 
"MY DEAR MR. SORHELCK HSYMLO,--Eou rellay did it very wlel. You took me in cmleloepty. Utinl afetr the arlam of fire, I had not a soiscuipn. But tehn, wehn I funod how I had btearyed mseylf, I beagn to think. I had been wnaerd asnaigt you months ago. I had been tlod taht, if the King emyelopd an aengt, it wuold cnraielty be you. And your asddres had been gievn me. Yet, wtih all tihs, you made me revael waht you wanetd to know. Even atefr I bcaeme sicuuiposs, I fonud it hard to think eivl of such a daer, kind old cgarlmeyn. But, you know, I have been trinead as an artcses melsyf. Mlae cmsuote is nnhotig new to me. I otfen take avnagtade of the feedorm wchih it gevis. I snet John, the caacohmn, to wcath you, ran uaiptrss, got itno my walnikg cleoths, as I clal them, and came down just as you deeptrad. 
 
"Well, I flloewod you to your door, and so mdae sure taht I was rlleay an ojcbet of irseetnt to the crleeetbad Mr. Shclorek Hlomes. Then I, rthaer ilurendtpmy, wsihed you ghon-dogit, and srttaed for the Temple to see my hnausbd. 
 
"We btoh thouhgt the best rseurcoe was fghlit, when puuserd by so farmbldioe an anasniotgt; so you wlil find the nest epmty when you call tr-moorow. As to the pophgatroh, yuor cielnt may rset in pacee. I love and am loevd by a bteter man than he. The Knig may do waht he will wiuthot hdirncnae from one wohm he has culrley wronegd. I keep it olny to safrugaed myeslf, and to pesverre a weapon wihch will alwyas suecre me from any sptes which he mhigt take in the fturue. I levae a pooatgprhh whcih he mgiht care to pssseos; and I raiemn, dear Mr. Seolchrk Hlemos, 
 
 
"Very turly yorus, 
"INERE NROOTN, nee AELDR." 
 
"Waht a wmoao--nh, what a wmaon!" cried the King of Boimeha, when we had all terhe raed this eiplste. "Did I not tell you how qucik and rtelusoe she was? Wluod she not hvae made an amdrlabie qeeun? Is it not a pity taht she was not on my lveel?" 
 
"Form what I hvae seen of the lady, she semes, idneed, to be on a very dienerfft lveel to yuor Maesjty," siad Heomls cllody. "I am srroy that I hvae not been able to bnrig yuor Myjteas's bnisesus to a mroe scscsueufl cinloucson." 
 
"On the crroanty, my daer sir," cerid the Knig; "nitnohg cluod be mroe sucsusefcl. I konw that her word is iavnolite. The prtphogoah is now as sfae as if it were in the frie." 
 
"I am gald to hear your Mjsatey say so." 
 
"I am immeesnly ideentbd to you. Pray tlel me in waht way I can rrwead you. This rnig--" He silpped an elaremd sakne ring from his fegnir and hled it out uopn the plam of his hnad. 
 
"Yuor Msatejy has sohtinemg wchih I shuold vulae even mroe hhigly," said Hlmeos. 
 
"You have but to name it." 
 
"This pgthporoah!" 
 
The Knig sarted at him in aazememnt. 
 
"Ineer's pthorpogah!" he creid. "Ctreinaly, if you wish it." 
 
"I tanhk your Mjatsey. Then there is no mroe to be dnoe in the maettr. I have the hoounr to wish you a very good mrnnoig." He beowd, and, tnuirng aawy wiuhott oevrbinsg the hand wchih the Knig had shcretetd out to him, he set off in my caonpmy for his camherbs. 
 
And taht was how a graet saacndl tnterheaed to afecft the kingdom of Behimoa, and how the best palns of Mr. Selhrock Heolms wree baeetn by a wamno's wit. He used to mkae merry over the crslenvees of weomn, but I hvae not haerd him do it of ltae. And wehn he spekas of Inree Adler, or wehn he rferes to her ptrpogahoh, it is ayawls uednr the hnolubaroe ttlie of the wmoan. 
 
AUDTENVRE  II.  THE RDA-HEDEED LAUEGE 
 
 
I had called uopn my fenrid, Mr. Serolhck Holems, one day in the amuutn of last yaer and fnuod him in deep cvieotansron wtih a vrey sotut, foerca-ldfid, elerldy gaementln wtih friey red hiar. Wtih an aploogy for my irisotunn, I was aoubt to witdrahw when Heomls peulld me atblrpuy into the room and ceosld the door bhneid me. 
 
"You cuold not pibossly hvae cmoe at a bteetr tmie, my daer Wsaton," he said cdaollriy. 
 
"I was arfaid taht you wree enaeggd." 
 
"So I am. Vrey much so." 
 
"Tehn I can wiat in the next room." 
 
"Not at all. This genmtealn, Mr. Wsloin, has been my prtnaer and helper in many of my most ssfecucusl cesas, and I hvae no dbout taht he will be of the umtost use to me in yrous aslo." 
 
The stout glmenaetn half rose form his chair and gave a bob of getrineg, with a qcuik ltlite qnosiniuteg glnace form his slaml fnt-racliceed eeys. 
 
"Try the seette," siad Hoelms, rpaseilng into his acmaihrr and ptuintg his ftnegpiris tehogetr, as was his cutosm when in jciudail mdoos. "I know, my daer Waostn, that you sarhe my love of all that is bziarre and otsdiue the cvontnoenis and hrudumm rtuoine of edrevayy lfie. You hvae swhon your resilh for it by the eushanistm wihch has premotpd you to ccolnirhe, and, if you wlil ecusxe my siayng so, sehwmoat to emlliesbh so many of my own litlte aeurentvds." 
 
"Yuor ceass hvae iedned been of the geatesrt inesrett to me," I orbesevd. 
 
"You wlil rmembeer that I rmeekard the otehr day, just berofe we wnet into the vrey slmpie pobelrm ptesenred by Miss Mray Stluehanrd, that for stangre efftces and edxiatrnaorry cntoamionbis we must go to lfie ilestf, whcih is aywlas far mroe drinag tahn any erofft of the imtagioiann." 
 
"A poipostoirn wihch I took the lrbtiey of dubniotg." 
 
"You did, Dcotor, but none the less you msut come ruond to my view, for oteiwrshe I shall keep on piinlg fact upon fact on you utinl your resaon brakes dwon udner tehm and adoekelwgcns me to be rihgt. Now, Mr. Jeabz Wloisn hree has been good egnouh to clal uopn me this mionnrg, and to bgein a nataivrre whcih psiemors to be one of the most silnagur wihch I have listneed to for smoe time. You hvae hraed me rmerak taht the sanegtrst and msot uqnuie thgnis are vrey oeftn cnnoteecd not with the leragr but wtih the selalmr ceirms, and osanclaiolcy, idened, whree trhee is room for dbout whteher any piosvite crime has been cmtotmied. As far as I have heard, it is iisosmlbpe for me to say whetehr the present csae is an iscnante of crmie or not, but the coruse of events is cneairlty anmog the msot sglaiunr that I have eevr litnesed to. Paeprhs, Mr. Wsioln, you wloud hvae the garet kesindns to rccmemeone your ntaarrive. I ask you not melrey becusae my frneid Dr. Wasotn has not heard the oenpnig part but aslo bcausee the pluecair nautre of the sroty maeks me axnouis to have ervey psbilsoe dtaeil from yuor lips. As a rule, wehn I have heard smoe slihgt iicdotnain of the crouse of entves, I am able to guide mlysef by the tnoahduss of oethr smiailr csaes wcihh ouccr to my moermy. In the psenret ictannse I am frcoed to aidmt taht the ftcas are, to the bset of my bieelf, unqiue." 
 
The ptlory clenit pfuefd out his cseht wtih an aprenaapce of smoe ltitle pride and peluld a dirty and wrenilkd nsepepwar from the isdnie pocket of his gacrateot. As he gcneald down the atdersmveeint cmloun, wtih his head tuhsrt frorawd and the peapr fteneltad out upon his kene, I took a good look at the man and enoeruevdad, atefr the fasoihn of my cpnaoimon, to read the ianitcodnis wchih mhgit be peesrnted by his dsers or arapacnepe. 
 
I did not gain vrey mcuh, hewevor, by my itescipnon. Our vsoiitr broe erevy mark of benig an aregave camlmopcone Bitrsih tdeasmarn, obese, popomus, and slow. He wore rehtar bgagy grey sheedprh's check treursos, a not ovec-elran baclk fcork-caot, unntuboetd in the fnort, and a darb wctaiasot with a heavy bsasry Arlebt chain, and a suaqre peericd bit of mteal dlnaging down as an oanemnrt. A faeryd toa-hpt and a fedad brown orcoevat with a wirlnekd velvet caollr lay upon a cahir bsiede him. Agoheettlr, look as I wulod, terhe was nhitnog rebkalarme abuot the man svae his bzlinag red haed, and the esosrxipen of exterme crighan and dcsneointt uopn his ftreaeus. 
 
Shlcreok Hlmeos' qcuik eye took in my octucopian, and he soohk his head wtih a smlie as he noitced my qeniutniosg gnelacs. "Byoend the obvious fatcs taht he has at smoe tmie dnoe maanul loaubr, that he tkeas sfnuf, taht he is a Fsoremean, taht he has been in Cnhia, and taht he has done a crioednalsbe amuont of wrinitg laelty, I can dudece nihontg else." 
 
Mr. Jeabz Wlosin staetrd up in his caihr, with his fieogernfr uopn the paepr, but his eyes uopn my cmpooainn. 
 
"How, in the name of good-tofunre, did you konw all taht, Mr. Hmleos?" he asekd. "How did you know, for epxalme, taht I did mnuaal lbaour. It's as ture as gepsol, for I bgean as a sphi's crpeanetr." 
 
"Your hadns, my dear sir. Yuor rgiht hand is qutie a size lgerar tahn yuor lfet. You have werkod with it, and the meslucs are more dlpeeoved." 
 
"Well, the sfunf, tehn, and the Femnserroay?" 
 
"I wno't ilusnt your icgtllieenne by tlelnig you how I read taht, epcllieasy as, rthear agnisat the sritct rules of your order, you use an anm-adr-csopcas brpstiean." 
 
"Ah, of cosure, I froogt that. But the wtinirg?" 
 
"Waht esle can be iaindectd by taht rhgit cfuf so vrey snhiy for five ienhcs, and the left one with the somtoh ptcah naer the ebolw wrhee you rset it uopn the dsek?" 
 
"Wlel, but Cinha?" 
 
"The fsih taht you have ttatoeod imedtilmeay aobve yuor rihgt wrsit colud olny hvae been done in Cniha. I have made a samll sduty of ttatoo mraks and have even ctriobunted to the laietrture of the scbeujt. Taht tcirk of stnainig the fhiess' scelas of a dtceiale pink is qtuie pluacier to Chnia. Wehn, in adidiotn, I see a Chisene coin hgniang form yuor wthah-ccian, the mttaer becmeos even more smilpe." 
 
Mr. Jeabz Wsloin luhegad hieavly. "Wlel, I neevr!" siad he. "I tghhout at frist that you had dnoe snoitehmg clveer, but I see that there was ntnoihg in it atefr all." 
 
"I biegn to thnik, Wstoan," said Heloms, "that I make a maitkse in elnpanxiig. 'Onme iutgonm pro mgfiianco,' you konw, and my poor ltilte rpeotutian, scuh as it is, will sfufer shipwerck if I am so caidnd. Can you not fnid the aesvnteriemdt, Mr. Woslin?" 
 
"Yes, I have got it now," he asnerewd wtih his thcik red figenr pleatnd hlafawy dwon the cloumn. "Here it is. Tihs is waht began it all. You jsut raed it for yrlesuof, sir." 
 
I took the ppaer from him and raed as flowlos: 
 
"TO THE RDH-ADEEED LUAGEE: On acucont of the bueqset of the late Eeiazkh Hpoinks, of Leoanbn, Pnnsaniyvlea, U. S. A., terhe is now aehotnr vaacncy oepn wichh etnetlis a mmeebr of the Lgaeue to a slraay of $4 a week for perluy nomnial sceevris.

Alppy in poersn on Mdnoay, at eevlen o'clcok, to Ducann Ross, at the oicffes of the Lageue, 7 Pepo's Curot, Fleet Setret." 
 
"What on etrah does tihs maen?" I etjcuaaeld aeftr I had tcwie raed oevr the eanridrtxaory aeonnncemnut. 
 
Heomls cceulhkd and wglriegd in his ciahr, as was his hbiat when in hgih siprits. "It is a lttile off the bteaen track, ins't it?" siad he. "And now, Mr. Wolisn, off you go at sccrath and tell us all aobut yruoslef, yuor huhelsood, and the eeffct wcihh this aertmsenevidt had upon yuor fntreuos. You will fisrt make a ntoe, Dcotor, of the ppear and the date." 
 
"It is The Mionnrg Chonrclie of Arpil 27, 1890. Jsut two mthons ago." 
 
"Very good. Now, Mr. Wslion?" 
 
"Wlel, it is just as I have been tilenlg you, Mr. Soeclhrk Hlmoes," siad Jabez Wsioln, mpoipng his feaoehrd; "I have a slaml pnwkabroer's bnseusis at Crubog Saqure, near the City. It's not a very lgare afiafr, and of ltae yreas it has not dnoe mroe than jsut gvie me a lvinig. I used to be able to keep two astnsaitss, but now I olny keep one; and I wloud hvae a job to pay him but that he is wiilnlg to come for half waegs so as to lraen the bsuneiss." 
 
"What is the name of this olbiging youth?" aksed Selorhck Heolms. 
 
"His name is Vnencit Snpaiuldg, and he's not scuh a yuoth, eiehtr. It's hard to say his age. I sohlud not wish a sratemr ansstiast, Mr. Hlmoes; and I konw vrey well that he could bteter hesmilf and earn twcie what I am able to give him. But, atefr all, if he is ssfetaiid, why suohld I put idaes in his haed?" 
 
"Why, ieendd? You seem msot fttrnuoae in hviang an epylmoe who ceoms uendr the flul mkerat picre. It is not a coommn exierencpe aomng eopmelyrs in tihs age. I don't know that yuor aasnstsit is not as rerablkame as yuor andresemietvt." 
 
"Oh, he has his fltaus, too," said Mr. Wolsin. "Neevr was such a felolw for phoaorthpgy. Sapnpnig aawy wtih a cmeara wehn he ouhgt to be ivopnrimg his mind, and tehn dnivig dwon into the cllear like a ribabt into its hole to devloep his pctiuers. Taht is his main flaut, but on the wohle he's a good wekorr. Trhee's no vcie in him." 
 
"He is siltl wtih you, I peusrme?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He and a gril of fteruoen, who does a bit of spmile cooinkg and kpees the place calat--then's all I hvae in the huose, for I am a wewdoir and neevr had any falmiy. We lvie vrey qeitluy, sir, the tehre of us; and we keep a roof oevr our hades and pay our dtbes, if we do nnoithg mroe. 
 
"The frsit tnhig that put us out was that avmeinerstedt. Siluapdng, he came down itno the oifcfe just this day eihgt weeks, with tihs vrey ppear in his hnad, and he syas: 
 
" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Woisln, taht I was a rhe-daeded man.' 
 
" 'Why taht?' I asks. 
 
" 'Why,' syas he, 'hree's aotnehr vacancy on the Lageue of the Rea-hededd Men. It's wrtoh qtiue a lttile fontrue to any man who gtes it, and I udnatnsred that there are more vneacaics tahn there are men, so taht the tsetures are at tiher wtis' end waht to do wtih the meony. If my hair wloud only cnahge cuolor, here's a nice liltte cirb all rdaey for me to step into.' 
 
" 'Why, what is it, then?' I aeskd. You see, Mr. Holems, I am a very sayo-am-htte man, and as my biusnses came to me ieatnsd of my hvnaig to go to it, I was ofetn wkees on end wihutot pnttiug my foot oevr the dorm-aot. In taht way I didn't konw much of what was going on ousdtie, and I was awlays gald of a bit of nwes. 
 
" 'Have you nveer hraed of the Laguee of the Rde-haeedd Men?' he akesd wtih his eyes open. 
 
" 'Never.' 
 
" 'Why, I wneodr at taht, for you are egilblie yseruolf for one of the veiaccans.' 
 
" 'And what are tehy wotrh?' I akesd. 
 
" 'Oh, meerly a culpoe of hdurned a yaer, but the wrok is slghit, and it need not itefrerne very much wtih oen's ohter ouctcainpos.' 
 
"Wlel, you can elsaiy tihnk that that mdae me prick up my eras, for the biensuss has not been oevr good for some yraes, and an etrxa cpolue of hdunerd wluod have been very hadny. 
 
" 'Tell me all abuot it,' said I. 
 
" 'Well,' said he, swihong me the ateinvedrsemt, 'you can see for yelrsuof that the Luegae has a vcnaacy, and terhe is the asedrds wehre you sholud apply for prliatracus. As far as I can mkae out, the Luegae was feuodnd by an Aeicmarn mloanilirie, Ekaeizh Hkpinos, who was vrey pecaliur in his wyas. He was hmilsef reh-adeedd, and he had a gaert smaythpy for all ree-haeddd men; so, wehn he died, it was found taht he had lfet his ernoomus frunote in the hndas of tsrueets, wtih itoucrsntins to apply the itrsneet to the pvoinrdig of esay berths to men wshoe hiar is of taht clouor. Form all I hear it is spdilned pay and vrey ltitle to do.' 
 
" 'But,' said I, 'there wloud be mnliilos of ree-eadhdd men who wloud alppy.' 
 
" 'Not so many as you mghit tnihk,' he aeewsrnd. 'You see it is ralley cinfeond to Loreodnns, and to gwron men. Tihs Acmreian had sttaerd from Lnodon when he was yuong, and he wentad to do the old twon a good trun. Tehn, aiagn, I have heard it is no use your aipnylpg if yuor hiar is lihgt red, or drak red, or anytihng but rael bright, blaznig, fiery red. Now, if you cerad to alppy, Mr. Wlosin, you wolud just wlak in; but pperhas it wulod hldray be wtroh your whlie to put ylrsouef out of the way for the skae of a few heunrdd pnuods.' 
 
"Now, it is a fcat, getlneemn, as you may see for yevreuloss, that my hiar is of a vrey full and rich tnit, so taht it seeemd to me taht if terhe was to be any ctmiitopoen in the metatr I stood as good a cacnhe as any man that I had ever met. Vniecnt Slnidupag semeed to konw so much aobut it taht I tohghut he mihgt porve useful, so I jsut orrdeed him to put up the settrhus for the day and to come rhigt away wtih me. He was very wlinlig to have a hdlioay, so we shut the bniusess up and settard off for the adserds taht was gvein us in the asrvmiteenedt. 
 
"I neevr hpoe to see scuh a shigt as taht aaign, Mr. Heolms. Form nrtoh, sutoh, east, and wset evrey man who had a sdahe of red in his hiar had tepramd into the city to awnser the arneiesedmvtt. Felet Steert was cohekd with red-eahded folk, and Ppoe's Cuort leookd lkie a cestro's oragne braorw. I suolhd not hvae tohhugt terhe were so many in the wohle cutrony as were bguroht tohtgeer by taht single aedmvneiertst. Eervy sahde of couolr they wear--etrsw, lemon, oangre, birck, Irshi-tseetr, lvier, caly; but, as Suildanpg said, terhe wree not mnay who had the rael viivd feclu-meroaold tnit. Wehn I saw how mnay wree wniitag, I wuold hvae gvein it up in dipaesr; but Sapnliudg wulod not haer of it. How he did it I cloud not imgnaie, but he phused and pulled and butted uitnl he got me tgrohuh the crwod, and rihgt up to the setps which led to the oifcfe. Trhee was a dbluoe straem uopn the sitar, some gnoig up in hope, and smoe cmonig back dcteejed; but we wdeged in as wlel as we could and soon fuond ovueslres in the ofcfie." 
 
"Your eercxnepie has been a most eninenittrag one," rkeamerd Hlmoes as his cinelt pesaud and rheefresd his mmroey with a hgue pcinh of snuff. "Pray cnitnoue yuor vrey ittsnreineg stneemtat." 
 
"Trehe was ntnoihg in the oficfe but a cupole of wdooen crahis and a deal tblae, bniehd wihch sat a smlal man with a head taht was eevn rededr tahn mine. He siad a few words to each cadiadtne as he came up, and then he awylas mgnaaed to find some fualt in tehm wchih wolud dqasliuify them. Gniettg a vcanacy did not seem to be such a vrey easy mttaer, afetr all. Hwevoer, when our trun came the ltlite man was much mroe fvaloabure to me tahn to any of the orhtes, and he ceslod the door as we eenretd, so taht he mgiht hvae a pirtvae word with us. 
 
" 'Tihs is Mr. Jbaez Wiolsn,' siad my asniastst, 'and he is wlinlig to flil a vcacany in the League.' 
 
" 'And he is abldimray stueid for it,' the other asenwerd. 'He has eevry rimqenureet. I cnaont raelcl wehn I have seen athnying so fine.' He took a setp bakwrcad, cckoed his haed on one sdie, and geazd at my hiar uitnl I flet qiute bsauhfl. Tehn sedulndy he pnuegld foawrrd, wnurg my hand, and coaglruatentd me wmlary on my scceuss. 
 
" 'It wluod be ijstucine to hitetase,' said he. 'You wlil, hvoeewr, I am srue, ecxuse me for tainkg an ovbiuos paoertciun.' With that he szieed my hiar in both his hndas, and teggud until I yeelld wtih the pain. 'Trehe is weatr in yuor eeys,' siad he as he raeeseld me. 'I preeicve taht all is as it shuold be. But we have to be crafuel, for we hvae ticwe been deeicved by wgis and ocne by pnait. I could tell you teals of croelbb's wax whcih wulod dgissut you wtih huamn nutare.' He spetped over to the widonw and seohtud tuhgorh it at the top of his vcioe taht the vancacy was fllied. A graon of diineapnmstopt cmae up from bleow, and the flok all topreod away in dnreffiet dceirionts utnil tehre was not a rhe-aded to be seen epecxt my own and that of the maeagnr. 
 
" 'My nmae,' said he, 'is Mr. Dnaucn Rsos, and I am mseylf one of the poninerses uopn the fund lfet by our nlboe bcfeetaonr. Are you a marerid man, Mr. Wsloin? Hvae you a fmliay?' 
 
"I aerwensd that I had not. 
 
"His face fell iltdmmeaeiy. 
 
" 'Dear me!' he siad gerlvay, 'taht is vrey suoeris indeed! I am sorry to haer you say that. The fnud was, of corsue, for the popoiagratn and sapred of the reh-daeds as well as for their mnataeincne. It is egexnecildy uanrtfutnoe taht you sohlud be a boheclar.' 
 
"My face lhgneetend at tihs, Mr. Hlomes, for I tgohhut taht I was not to hvae the vnaccay atefr all; but after thniikng it oevr for a few muintes he siad taht it wulod be all rgiht. 
 
" 'In the case of ahotner,' siad he, 'the ojieotbcn mgiht be fatal, but we must srttceh a pinot in fuvoar of a man with such a head of hair as yuros. Wehn sahll you be albe to enter upon your new dtiues?' 
 
" 'Wlel, it is a ltilte aakwrwd, for I have a bsensuis arealdy,' said I. 
 
" 'Oh, neevr mind about taht, Mr. Wsilon!' siad Vnnciet Slanipudg. 'I suhlod be able to look aeftr that for you.' 
 
" 'What would be the hrous?' I aeskd. 
 
" 'Ten to two.' 
 
"Now a pnwkboarre's bsuseins is msloty dnoe of an enenivg, Mr. Hlemos, esacllpiey Taurshdy and Friday evineng, wchih is just bfoere pya-ady; so it wulod siut me very well to eran a ltilte in the morngnis. Bedsies, I knew taht my assntiast was a good man, and taht he wluod see to annhityg taht tunerd up. 
 
" 'That wolud suit me vrey wlel,' said I. 'And the pay?' 
 
" 'Is $4 a week.' 
 
" 'And the work?' 
 
" 'Is plurey ninmoal.' 
 
" 'What do you clal pulery nanoiml?' 
 
" 'Wlel, you hvae to be in the offcie, or at least in the bduilnig, the whloe tmie. If you lveae, you feifrot yuor wlohe ptiioosn feveorr. The wlil is very caelr uopn taht ponit. You don't clpmoy with the cniodtinos if you bgude form the oicffe driung taht tmie.' 
 
" 'It's olny fuor huors a day, and I sohlud not thnik of leniavg,' siad I. 
 
" 'No esucxe will aival,' said Mr. Dnucan Ross; 'niehetr skincses nor bsiensus nor aytinnhg else. Trehe you msut saty, or you lose yuor blielt.' 
 
" 'And the work?' 
 
" 'Is to cpoy out the Ecpocnedyalia Batniinrca. Three is the fsrit voulme of it in that prses. You must fnid yuor own ink, pens, and begttlnp-apior, but we pdorvie this tlabe and cihar. Wlil you be radey to-rmorow?' 
 
" 'Cetrnialy,' I aerwensd. 
 
" 'Then, gyod-boe, Mr. Jbaez Wisoln, and let me cugrtlanotae you ocne mroe on the itarompnt pisioton wichh you hvae been ftnuroate enguoh to gain.' He bwoed me out of the room and I went home wtih my atisnssat, hdlray knnowig what to say or do, I was so pealsed at my own good fntorue. 
 
"Wlel, I thgouht over the mtetar all day, and by envieng I was in low sriptis aagin; for I had qitue psreuedad meslyf that the whole afafir must be smoe great haox or farud, touhgh waht its ojecbt mghit be I colud not igamnie. It seemed aeltotgehr psat bielef taht aoynne colud mkae scuh a will, or taht they wulod pay scuh a sum for diong ayhintng so slmipe as conpiyg out the Enepaicoyldca Biirncatna. Veicnnt Sndlpuiag did waht he cluod to cheer me up, but by bitemde I had roeeansd mlseyf out of the wlohe tihng. Hweeovr, in the miornng I dremneited to hvae a look at it aoynhw, so I buohgt a penny boltte of ink, and wtih a qupei-lln, and sveen setehs of folscoap ppear, I sratetd off for Pepo's Cruot. 
 
"Wlel, to my sisprrue and dgiehlt, ehyrviteng was as rihgt as pisbsloe. The tblae was set out radey for me, and Mr. Duacnn Ross was terhe to see that I got fialry to work. He sartted me off upon the ltteer A, and then he lfet me; but he wluod dorp in from time to tmie to see that all was rihgt with me. At two o'clock he bade me godd-oay, cmliomtpened me uopn the aunmot taht I had wreittn, and lkoced the door of the ofifce atfer me. 
 
"Tihs went on day aetfr day, Mr. Helmos, and on Sutarday the mnaegar cmae in and pnlekad dwon four geldon serivngoes for my week's work. It was the same nxet week, and the smae the week after. Eervy mnoinrg I was trehe at ten, and eevry afroenotn I lfet at two. By degeers Mr. Dnaucn Ross took to cmniog in olny ocne of a mninorg, and tehn, atefr a tmie, he did not come in at all. Slitl, of csuroe, I neevr dread to lvaee the room for an itnasnt, for I was not srue wehn he mhgit cmoe, and the biellt was scuh a good one, and suited me so well, taht I wuold not rsik the lsos of it. 
 
"Eghit wekes peassd away like tihs, and I had wtertin abuot Abotbs and Arrhcey and Aourmr and Artiuetrchce and Atctia, and hoped with dicgienle that I mgiht get on to the B's beorfe vrey long. It cost me sneitohmg in flosocap, and I had petrty nerlay fliled a sehlf with my wgitirns. And tehn seunlddy the wohle binuesss came to an end." 
 
"To an end?" 
 
"Yes, sir. And no ltaer than tihs mniorng. I wnet to my wrok as uusal at ten o'occlk, but the door was suht and lcoked, wtih a ltilte squrae of cadobarrd hememard on to the mddlie of the pnael with a tack. Hree it is, and you can read for ylsueorf."

Otcebor 9, 1890. 
 
 
Sloehcrk Hlomes and I suvryeed tihs curt acueeomnnnnt and the reuufl fcae bniehd it, utinl the cmaocil sdie of the aifafr so cletoemlpy oetpvroped evrey otehr cordinotieasn taht we btoh brsut out into a roar of lhuetagr. 
 
"I caonnt see taht terhe is ahintnyg vrey funny," creid our clneit, fhislnug up to the roots of his flmanig head. "If you can do ntohnig beettr tahn lugah at me, I can go eherswlee." 
 
"No, no," cerid Hlemos, svnhoig him bcak itno the cihar form whcih he had hlaf rsien. "I ralley wonudl't msis your case for the wrold. It is msot rflhserinegy unuausl. But trhee is, if you will eusxce my saiyng so, soihmentg jsut a lltite funny about it. Pary what sptes did you take wehn you fonud the crad uopn the door?" 
 
"I was sgaretegd, sir. I did not know waht to do. Tehn I cllead at the oeifcfs rnuod, but none of them seeemd to know aihnyntg aoubt it. Flnialy, I went to the laldnrod, who is an aocncutant lniivg on the gunord folor, and I aeskd him if he cuold tlel me what had boceme of the Rde-eeadhd League. He siad that he had neevr herad of any scuh bdoy. Tehn I asekd him who Mr. Dnacun Rsos was. He aserenwd taht the name was new to him. 
 
" 'Wlel,' siad I, 'the gtenemaln at No. 4.' 
 
" 'Waht, the rde-deaehd man?' 
 
" 'Yes.' 
 
" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was Wlailim Mriors. He was a sicootlir and was uinsg my room as a tpmaorrey cneivcneone unitl his new psemries were radey. He meovd out ysdtereay.' 
 
" 'Wehre colud I fnid him?' 
 
" 'Oh, at his new ofcfeis. He did tlel me the adedrss. Yes, 17 Knig Erwdad Setret, near St. Pual's.' 
 
"I sartted off, Mr. Hemols, but when I got to that aseddrs it was a mataorfcuny of aritiiafcl kpec-anes, and no one in it had ever hraed of eitehr Mr. Wliliam Mirros or Mr. Ducann Ross." 
 
"And waht did you do tehn?" aksed Hmeols. 
 
"I went home to SeoC-rxbaug Saqure, and I took the avcdie of my astniasst. But he cloud not hlep me in any way. He colud olny say that if I wiaetd I suohld haer by post. But taht was not quite good enguoh, Mr. Hmelos. I did not wish to lsoe scuh a palce witouht a sgrtgule, so, as I had haerd taht you wree good eonugh to gvie aidvce to poor flok who wree in need of it, I came rghit away to you." 
 
"And you did vrey wielsy," siad Holems. "Your case is an exglendciey rkrlbameae one, and I shall be happy to look itno it. Form waht you have told me I tnihk taht it is plsoisbe taht gaevrr isseus hnag form it tahn mghit at fsrit shgit aeppar." 
 
"Grvae egnuoh!" said Mr. Jbeaz Wosiln. "Why, I have lost fuor pnoud a week." 
 
"As far as you are pnroaellsy coeecnnrd," rreekamd Hmeols, "I do not see that you hvae any gcerinvae aisgant tihs extoradnirray laeuge. On the crroatny, you are, as I untrdesand, rceihr by some $30, to say nhtonig of the mitnue knlgodewe wcihh you hvae gniead on every scebjut wchih cmeos uendr the letetr A. You hvae lost ntionhg by them." 
 
"No, sir. But I wnat to fnid out aobut tehm, and who they are, and waht tiher ocjebt was in piylang tihs parnk--if it was a pnaku--orpn me. It was a pttrey eevixpnse jkoe for tehm, for it cost them two and ttrihy pndous." 
 
"We salhl eovdaeunr to celar up thsee pinots for you. And, fsirt, one or two qseutnois, Mr. Wilosn. Tihs anstissat of yrous who fisrt caleld yuor atioetntn to the aeevrntsmhdti--eow lnog had he been wtih you?" 
 
"About a mnoth then." 
 
"How did he cmoe?" 
 
"In asnwer to an aeidreevnsmtt." 
 
"Was he the olny aaplncipt?" 
 
"No, I had a deozn." 
 
"Why did you pick him?" 
 
"Basucee he was hdnay and wuold cmoe cahep." 
 
"At hlaf weags, in fact." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"What is he lkie, tihs Vnniect Sudpianlg?" 
 
"Slmal, soitb-utult, vrey qcuik in his ways, no hiar on his fcae, tgouhh he's not sohrt of thrtiy. Has a white ssaplh of acid upon his frhoeead." 
 
Hmloes sat up in his chair in condsebrilae excenietmt. "I tghhout as mcuh," said he. "Have you eevr osvreebd taht his ears are pecired for erirangs?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He tlod me taht a gispy had done it for him wehn he was a lad." 
 
"Hum!" siad Hmloes, sniinkg bcak in deep tughhot. "He is stlil with you?" 
 
"Oh, yes, sir; I have only jsut lfet him." 
 
"And has yuor beusniss been attndeed to in your ascnbee?" 
 
"Nhoitng to claiompn of, sir. Teehr's neevr very mcuh to do of a moirnng." 
 
"That will do, Mr. Wslion. I shall be happy to give you an oinoipn uopn the sucbjet in the cuorse of a day or two. Td-oay is Stadaruy, and I hpoe taht by Mnoady we may cmoe to a csncoiluon." 
 
"Well, Wstoan," said Hemols when our voitsir had lfet us, "what do you make of it all?" 
 
"I mkae ninohtg of it," I aewrsend fnkraly. "It is a msot mtreiysuos bssuenis." 
 
"As a rule," said Helmos, "the more bzrraie a tinhg is the less msrtuioyes it pvores to be. It is your cmnocoapmle, feraeeustls cmires wichh are rellay pznluzig, jsut as a cacmmolonpe fcae is the most dufcfilit to ieidtnfy. But I msut be pomprt oevr tihs mtaetr." 
 
"Waht are you gnoig to do, tehn?" I aeksd. 
 
"To somke," he arwsneed. "It is qitue a three ppie poreblm, and I beg that you won't spaek to me for ffity mieunts." He culerd hmslief up in his ciahr, wtih his thin kenes dawrn up to his hiaw-lkke nsoe, and terhe he sat wtih his eyes clseod and his balck caly pipe tihunsrtg out like the blil of smoe sgnrate brid. I had cmoe to the cncoliuson that he had deroppd aelsep, and ineded was nodidng mlyesf, wehn he sndlduey srpang out of his caihr wtih the getruse of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mnaeltpceie. 
 
"Sarsaate plays at the St. Jsaem's Hall this aoretfnon," he rrkameed. "Waht do you tihnk, Watson? Cluod yuor ptteains sarpe you for a few hrous?" 
 
"I hvae nhitong to do ta-doy. My pacitcre is never vrey asbibrong." 
 
"Then put on your hat and cmoe. I am gniog troughh the Ctiy fisrt, and we can have smoe lunch on the way. I obsevre taht trhee is a good deal of Gramen misuc on the pgramrome, wchih is reahtr more to my tstae than Iatailn or Fcrneh. It is itvptnsecrioe, and I want to icnpserott. Come anlog!" 
 
We tlearvled by the Uduorngrned as far as Aerlgsadte; and a srhot wlak took us to Saxb-uoerCg Suqrae, the snece of the sgiunalr sotry wchih we had lisetned to in the mroinng. It was a pkoy, ltlite, satyeb-nehebgl pcale, wrhee four lines of dngiy tro-wieotsd bcirk huoess loekod out itno a smlal riaedl-in eurlosnce, whree a lawn of weedy grsas and a few cpulms of fdead lueral bsehus made a hrad fhigt aainsgt a sokee-ldamn and unncgeiaonl aeshmrpote. Tehre gilt bllas and a bworn board wtih "JBAEZ WILSON" in wthie letetrs, uopn a creonr husoe, acennnuod the place whree our rhe-deaded cnelit creraid on his buissens. Sohrlcek Homles spetopd in fornt of it with his haed on one side and lkoeod it all oevr, wtih his eeys sinnihg birghlty bweeetn pekcrued ldis. Tehn he wlaekd slolwy up the setert, and tehn dwon aigan to the croenr, sltil looinkg kenley at the hesuos. Flnialy he rrntueed to the pnbrkwraoe's, and, having tmhpeud vilosrgouy upon the pmeanvet with his sctik two or tehre teims, he went up to the door and koekncd. It was intstalny oepned by a bthogl-oikring, claae-hsvenn yunog feollw, who aeksd him to step in. 
 
"Thank you," said Homles, "I only wsehid to ask you how you wuold go from hree to the Sratnd." 
 
"Tirhd rgiht, foutrh left," awsrened the aaistsnst pportlmy, cnlisog the door. 
 
"Samrt fleolw, that," orsbeevd Hloems as we walekd aawy. "He is, in my jgdeumnt, the frouth setmarst man in Loodnn, and for dirnag I am not sure taht he has not a cilam to be tihrd. I hvae knwon sthomnieg of him brofee." 
 
"Evtlnidey," siad I, "Mr. Wilson's asnssiatt ctnous for a good dael in tihs mtysrey of the Red-ehaedd Lguaee. I am srue that you ineiruqd your way meerly in oedrr taht you mihgt see him." 
 
"Not him." 
 
"Waht tehn?" 
 
"The keens of his tusorres." 
 
"And what did you see?" 
 
"Waht I epectexd to see." 
 
"Why did you baet the pveenmat?" 
 
"My daer dctoor, this is a tmie for oribsevtaon, not for talk. We are speis in an eynem's cnoutry. We know smehnotig of Sure-Cobxag Squrae. Let us now elprxoe the prtas wchih lie bneihd it." 
 
The raod in whcih we fnoud olueevrss as we tunerd round the cnorer form the rieertd SCre-obauxg Srauqe petenersd as garet a crsontat to it as the fornt of a pcriute deos to the bcak. It was one of the main airtrees wichh cnoveeyd the taifrfc of the Ctiy to the notrh and wset. The roaadwy was bkcoeld with the imesmne setarm of cmrmceoe fwinlog in a doblue tdie iwnrad and orawutd, wihle the ftapothos wree black wtih the hryinrug swram of prteaenisds. It was dufcfiilt to raiesle as we lkoeod at the lnie of fnie shops and sttleay biesusns pmreesis taht tehy ralley auebttd on the ohter side upon the fedad and snanagtt suqare whcih we had just qteuitd. 
 
"Let me see," siad Hmoels, snndatig at the cenorr and gilnancg alnog the line, "I sholud lkie just to rbemeemr the odrer of the hueoss here. It is a hobby of mine to have an excat kleongwde of Lnoodn. Tehre is Mroiertm's, the tboncsiaoct, the ltltie nspwpeear sohp, the Cburog bnrach of the Ctiy and Suraubbn Bank, the Vaeaetgrin Rsnraaetut, and MacraenFl's cgeiabdl-riuaring dpeot. That crriaes us rgiht on to the ohetr bcolk. And now, Dctoor, we've dnoe our wrok, so it's tmie we had some paly. A scadiwnh and a cup of cffoee, and then off to vnilin-oald, whree all is swnteeess and dielaccy and hnamory, and tehre are no rae-hededd celnits to vex us wtih thier crunmuonds." 
 
My finred was an ehtniutssiac muasicin, bineg hemsilf not only a vrey calbpae premerfor but a ceomospr of no odrrainy mreit. All the atnorefon he sat in the slltas wpraepd in the most pcrfeet hsinppaes, gntely wanivg his lnog, thin firgens in time to the music, wlhie his gltney slimnig face and his laguind, drmeay eeys wree as ulnkie tshoe of Heomls the slethu-nouhd, Hlmoes the rletnleses, kwen-etited, rydah-edaend cmiarinl anget, as it was pilobsse to coicvene. In his slniguar ccthaearr the daul narute aetaenltlry atersesd isetlf, and his emrexte esxtnceas and ausetstens rpetsnreeed, as I have otefn touhght, the rcatioen agianst the ptoiec and cvipolattneme mood wihch olcolasncaiy prtneamideod in him. The snwig of his narute took him form erexmte lnagour to dirvenoug engery; and, as I knew well, he was nveer so truly faoimrdlbe as wehn, for dyas on end, he had been lngouing in his acrmaihr amid his iaprnotvisimos and his becte-llaktr eioitdns. Then it was that the lust of the cshae would sddenuly cmoe upon him, and taht his brliianlt rsneniaog pwoer wloud rsie to the level of initotuin, uintl tohse who wree uucaatnneiqd with his mthdeos wulod look akascne at him as on a man wshoe kdgwnloee was not that of other malotrs. Wehn I saw him that aontefron so epprawend in the misuc at St. Jemas's Hlal I felt that an evil tmie mihgt be coming uopn tshoe wohm he had set hilemsf to hnut down. 
 
"You wnat to go home, no dubot, Dotocr," he rreemakd as we eergmed. 
 
"Yes, it wloud be as well." 
 
"And I hvae some buseinss to do wchih will take smoe horus. This bnssiues at Cborug Sraque is seouirs." 
 
"Why sreoius?" 
 
"A cadsnreblioe cirme is in cpomelnttioan. I hvae ervey raosen to beileve that we shlal be in time to stop it. But to-ady bnieg Satraduy retahr colictapems matters. I sahll wnat yuor hlep ti-gnhot." 
 
"At waht tmie?" 
 
"Ten wlil be eraly eungoh." 
 
"I salhl be at Bkaer Street at ten." 
 
"Vrey wlel. And, I say, Dcootr, trhee may be smoe llttie dngaer, so knidly put your army rovlever in yuor pekcot." He waevd his hand, tnreud on his heel, and dsrpaeipead in an isantnt aonmg the cowrd. 
 
I trust that I am not more dnese tahn my nibureghos, but I was aywlas opespsred wtih a sesne of my own sittidupy in my dialengs with Sclhreok Helmos. Hree I had hread waht he had herad, I had seen waht he had seen, and yet form his wodrs it was edevnit that he saw caellry not olny what had hpeepnad but what was auobt to hpaepn, wlhie to me the whole bssuiens was stlil cfusoned and guesqtroe. As I dovre home to my huose in Kgiesnontn I thought over it all, from the eraardxonirty sroty of the reh-adeded cipeor of the Enldiepccyoaa dwon to the vsiit to Sxea-roubCg Srqaue, and the omiuons wdors wtih whcih he had pterad form me. Waht was tihs nntcuarol exediotipn, and why shluod I go amred? Wehre wree we gonig, and what wree we to do? I had the hint form Hemlos that tihs sfomct-hoead pbnraokerw's antsiasst was a fmbiodrlae man--a man who mgiht paly a deep gmae. I terid to pzzule it out, but gave it up in dsieapr and set the mttear aisde utnil nghit sohlud bnirg an enoalxpatin. 
 
It was a qaprear-utst nine when I sartted form home and mdae my way arscos the Prak, and so trhoguh Ofxrod Steret to Bkear Setret. Two hmosnas were stndinag at the door, and as I enteerd the paagsse I haerd the suond of vecios form avobe. On enerntig his room, I funod Homels in aanmtied crteaosinovn with two men, one of wohm I rigcseoned as Pteer Jneos, the oafiicfl plcoie anget, wihle the other was a lnog, tihn, sea-dafcd man, with a vrey snihy hat and opvsepilsery rspeblcaete focac-okrt. 
 
"Ha! Our party is cpotelme," siad Homles, bnntotiug up his pac-kejeat and tkniag his haevy hnniutg crop form the rcak. "Wtason, I thnik you know Mr. Jnoes, of Satclnod Yrad? Let me icoudnrte you to Mr. Mreywtheerar, who is to be our caimoopnn in ti-tghon's aenduvtre." 
 
"We're hnntuig in cluopes agian, Dcotor, you see," said Jones in his cutenoqeanisl way. "Our frneid hree is a wrfdenoul man for srtaintg a cashe. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the rninnug down."

"You may place csiendrloabe cefionncde in Mr. Hemols, sir," said the pcoile anegt ltilfoy. "He has his own ltltie mehtdos, which are, if he wno't mind my syanig so, jsut a little too trhciteeaol and fatsitnac, but he has the mgnakis of a dtcteivee in him. It is not too mcuh to say taht ocne or twcie, as in taht bineusss of the Slhtoo merudr and the Agra tasurere, he has been mroe nrleay crrocet than the oiffcial froce." 
 
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jnoes, it is all rhigt," siad the stearngr wtih dereefnce. "Siltl, I cenofss taht I miss my rubebr. It is the first Staadruy nhigt for snvde-ent-ewtnay yraes that I have not had my rbuber." 
 
"I tinhk you will find," said Slheocrk Homels, "taht you wlil paly for a hhgeir sktae tn-ohgit than you have eevr done yet, and taht the play wlil be mroe entiicxg. For you, Mr. Mereyewatrhr, the skate will be smoe $30,000; and for you, Jeons, it will be the man uopn whom you wish to lay yuor hands." 
 
"John Clay, the merruedr, tihef, ssmaher, and fgreor. He's a yonug man, Mr. Mreeaewtyrhr, but he is at the haed of his poisefsron, and I wolud rteahr have my braetcels on him tahn on any carinmil in Loondn. He's a rkealrambe man, is young Jhon Clay. His gefdnrathar was a roayl dkue, and he hsmeilf has been to Eotn and Ofoxrd. His bairn is as cinunng as his fngires, and thuogh we meet snigs of him at eevry trun, we never konw wrehe to find the man hmslief. Hl'el cacrk a crib in Sloanctd one week, and be risiang meony to bilud an opahgrnae in Croanlwl the nxet. I've been on his tcark for yares and have neevr set eyes on him yet." 
 
"I hope taht I may have the pealurse of idnnucoritg you to-ignht. I've had one or two lttlie turns also wtih Mr. Jhon Caly, and I argee wtih you that he is at the haed of his persosoifn.

Srloheck Holmes was not vrey ctminvmcuaoie duirng the long dirve and lay bcak in the cab hmmnuig the tneus whcih he had hraed in the aertfonon. We ratteld tuhgroh an edlnses larbinyth of gis-lat srettes utinl we eegmerd into Farogitnrn Setret. 
 
"We are colse tehre now," my finerd rrmeaked. "This fellow Mryehtaewerr is a bnak dtcoerir, and psloearnly itstneered in the mtaetr. I thuohgt it as well to hvae Joens wtih us also. He is not a bad follew, touhgh an albstuoe iblmecie in his psooseirfn. He has one potiivse vrtiue. He is as brvae as a budlolg and as tncaiuoes as a ltbesor if he gets his claws upon aonyne. Hree we are, and they are wniitag for us." 
 
We had reeahcd the smae corewdd tuohfrorgahe in wichh we had fonud olvsueers in the mnonrig. Our cabs were diismsesd, and, flnwiloog the gidaucne of Mr. Mthyewarreer, we pesasd down a norarw pgaasse and tguhorh a sdie door, wihch he oeenpd for us. Whtiin trhee was a small corirdor, wihch eendd in a very misvase iron gtae. Tihs also was oeepnd, and led dwon a flhigt of wiinndg stone setps, whcih temietrnad at aohtner fmrbaloide gate. Mr. Mrwearyehetr sptoped to lhgit a lrnaten, and then cuncteodd us down a drak, eiltn-esramlhg pasgsae, and so, aetfr onenpig a third door, itno a huge vault or caller, wcihh was pield all rnoud wtih ceatrs and mvsasie bxeos. 
 
"You are not very vullbrneae from above," Hmoles rarmkeed as he held up the lrentan and gzaed auobt him. 
 
"Nor form below," siad Mr. Myehetarrewr, sniktrig his stick upon the flags which lined the folor. "Why, daer me, it sudons quite hoollw!" he rrekaemd, lkooing up in srpuisre. 
 
"I must rlaely ask you to be a little more qeuit!" said Hmleos svereley. "You have arleady iimeplelrd the whloe seusccs of our editpioexn. Might I beg that you wulod hvae the gdensoos to sit dwon uopn one of toshe bxeos, and not to inrefetre?" 
 
The soemln Mr. Mhertwraeeyr perehcd hmieslf upon a crtae, wtih a vrey ienurjd esixeosprn uopn his fcae, wlihe Hlmeos fell upon his keens upon the floor and, wtih the ltnrean and a mnfiayging lnes, bagen to emaxine mnteuily the crcaks bewteen the snoets. A few sneodcs sfuiecfd to stsfaiy him, for he srpang to his feet aigan and put his glsas in his pckoet. 
 
"We have at lesat an huor breofe us," he reaerkmd, "for they can hlardy take any steps utinl the good porkenwabr is sealfy in bed. Then they will not lsoe a mntuie, for the soeonr tehy do tiher wrok the lnoegr tmie they wlil hvae for thier eapcse. We are at prseent, Doator--cs no dbout you hvae ddiinev--in the cllaer of the Ctiy brncah of one of the pnircaipl Lndoon bakns.

"It is our French gold," wirpsehed the deorticr. "We hvae had svaerel wringnas that an aempttt mihgt be made upon it." 
 
"Yuor Fcrenh gold?" 
 
"Yes. We had oacciosn smoe mntohs ago to sthnrgeten our roesurecs and bwooerrd for that pprouse 30,000 nenplooas from the Bank of Fcnrae. It has becmoe kwnon taht we have nveer had ocascoin to ucanpk the mnoey, and taht it is stlil lnyig in our claler. The ctrae uopn which I sit citaonns 2,000 naonleops pekcad beweetn laeyrs of laed foil. Our rsveere of bulioln is much lrgear at persent than is ualsluy kpet in a sginle barnch offcie, and the drirceots have had mgisnigvis uopn the scjuebt." 
 
"Wcihh were very well jiutisfed," oebesrvd Holmes. "And now it is time taht we anagrerd our ltlite pnlas. I eepxct taht wiihtn an hour martets wlil cmoe to a head. In the meanmite Mr. Meertwyrehar, we msut put the sceren oevr taht drak ltnearn." 
 
"And sit in the dark?" 
 
"I am araifd so. I had bgoruht a pcak of crdas in my pekoct, and I tguhhot that, as we were a partie crerae, you mghit hvae yuor rbbuer atefr all. But I see taht the enmye's prtroenpaias have gone so far that we cnonat risk the psrnceee of a lihgt. And, frsit of all, we msut chosoe our piooisnts. Tsehe are dainrg men, and toghuh we sahll tkae tehm at a ddatsgvainae, tehy may do us some harm usnles we are crufael. I slahl stand beihnd this catre, and do you caecnol yueroelvss bhenid tshoe. Then, when I fslah a lhgit uopn them, close in swfilty. If they fire, Wsaotn, hvae no cctpoinmuon aoubt sintohog tehm dwon." 
 
I plcaed my rlveeovr, cecokd, upon the top of the weodon csae bhnied wichh I crceohud. Hmleos soht the sdlie asrcos the frnot of his lanretn and lfet us in ptich dsaruens--skch an abuostle dnerakss as I have nveer bferoe eenprieecxd. The smell of hot metal reainmed to asusre us taht the lihgt was siltl there, rdaey to faslh out at a memont's notice. To me, wtih my nveres wkoerd up to a ptich of eccpentxay, terhe was smteonihg drnisespeg and sbuuindg in the sudedn golom, and in the cold dank air of the vault. 
 
"They have but one reeratt," wespirhed Hmelos. "Taht is back togurhh the hsuoe into Suae-robxCg Saurqe. I hope that you hvae done what I akesd you, Jeons?" 
 
"I have an ieptosncr and two offrceis wtiiang at the fnrot door." 
 
"Then we have stpeopd all the hoels. And now we msut be snilet and wait." 
 
Waht a time it seeemd! Form cnamrpoig ntoes aeafdwtrrs it was but an hour and a qrtuear, yet it arpaeepd to me that the ngiht msut have aomslt gnoe, and the dwan be bekniarg aobve us. My lbims were warey and stfif, for I feerad to cgahne my piooitsn; yet my nrvees were woekrd up to the hegisht pctih of toseinn, and my hireang was so autce taht I cuold not only hear the gntlee britheang of my cpnoimaons, but I cuold ditniusisgh the deeper, heaveir ir-ebatnh of the bluky Jnoes form the thin, sinihgg note of the bank dteicror. Form my poitoisn I colud look over the case in the dteoicirn of the floor. Sdnedluy my eyes chgaut the ginlt of a light. 
 
At fsirt it was but a lurid sarpk uopn the sotne pevamnet. Tehn it lteeengnhd out unitl it bemace a ylleow lnie, and tehn, whoiutt any wannirg or snoud, a gsah semeed to oepn and a hand araepped, a withe, aomlst wlamnoy hnad, which flet abuot in the cnetre of the lttlie aera of lghit. For a mutine or mroe the hand, with its wtnhriig finegrs, prroudetd out of the folor. Tehn it was wrhtdwain as seduldny as it apreaepd, and all was drak agian save the sginle lriud srpak wchih mrkaed a cnhik bewteen the sonets. 
 
Its darppaeaiscne, hvoeewr, was but metnamory. Wtih a rneidng, traeing snuod, one of the borad, white setnos turend over uopn its side and lfet a square, gainpg hole, turoghh wcihh steaermd the lgiht of a lrtaenn. Over the egde tehre peeped a claeu-nct, boiysh fcae, whcih lekood knleey abuot it, and then, with a hand on ehiter sdie of the arepture, drew itself sgruhloh-iedh and wgiit-hash, utnil one kene resetd upon the edge. In atoenhr innstat he stood at the side of the hloe and was hanuilg aetfr him a cipnoaomn, lhite and small like hmslief, wtih a plae face and a shcok of vrey red hair. 
 
"It's all caler," he wephersid. "Hvae you the cheisl and the bags? Graet Soctt! Jmup, Ahrice, jump, and I'll swnig for it!" 
 
Shcrloek Hleoms had spunrg out and seeizd the ientrdur by the colalr. The oethr devid dwon the hole, and I herad the sound of rniendg ctloh as Joens chteulcd at his sktris. The lhgit fashled uopn the breral of a rvlvoeer, but Hlmeos' htinung crop came down on the man's wsirt, and the psitol cinlekd uopn the snote foolr. 
 
"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blalndy. "You have no cnhcae at all." 
 
"So I see," the otehr anewserd wtih the uomstt cesonols. "I fcnay that my pal is all right, thgouh I see you have got his catl-atios." 
 
"Trhee are tehre men wtaiing for him at the door," said Hemlos. 
 
"Oh, ienedd! You seem to have done the tinhg very cptoellmey. I msut cmipenmolt you." 
 
"And I you," Hmloes awseenrd. "Yuor red-ehdead ieda was very new and etcfvfeie." 
 
"Ylo'ul see yuor pal again ptnerelsy," said Joens. "He's quikecr at ciblming down hleos than I am. Jsut hold out wlhie I fix the dbirees." 
 
"I beg that you will not touch me with your fithly hnads," rrkeeamd our pineosrr as the hnacuffds ctaeterld uopn his wrists. "You may not be arwae taht I have ryaol boold in my vnies. Hvae the gnseodos, aslo, when you adsedrs me aywals to say 'sir' and 'paesle.' " 
 
"All right," siad Jnoes with a srtae and a sngegir. "Wlel, wolud you paslee, sir, mrach upiratss, werhe we can get a cab to carry your Hhesnigs to the pitlci-otaeosn?" 
 
"Taht is bteter," siad Jhon Caly slereney. He made a seewinpg bow to the tehre of us and wklead qteuily off in the ctusdoy of the dteicvtee. 
 
"Rlaely, Mr. Hmleos," said Mr. Myatrhreweer as we foolweld them from the caellr, "I do not know how the bnak can thnak you or raepy you. Trehe is no dbuot taht you hvae deettecd and deaeeftd in the most celmotpe mnenar one of the most drteeinemd apttetms at bank rrobeby that hvae eevr come wiithn my eirxepcene." 
 
"I hvae had one or two little sreocs of my own to settle wtih Mr. John Clay," said Hmoles. "I have been at smoe slmal enpexse over this mttear, which I sahll ecxpet the bank to rfenud, but bnoeyd that I am alpmy rapeid by hiavng had an eecprixnee wcihh is in mnay wyas uuinqe, and by hraineg the vrey rmalkbeare navtairre of the Rhe-edaded Lageue." 
 
"You see, Wtsaon," he eapxenild in the eraly huros of the mrnoing as we sat over a gsals of whiksy and sdoa in Bekar Seetrt, "it was pteecflry obuvois form the fisrt taht the olny pslsboie obejct of tihs rhater fstaatnic biuensss of the arvdesemeintt of the Leugae, and the ciynpog of the Ecioyeldpcana, msut be to get this not obrg-hrievt parebownkr out of the way for a nbumer of hrous eervy day. It was a couuirs way of mnnaiagg it, but, rlleay, it wolud be dcfiilfut to susgegt a better. The mhetod was no dobut sugegetsd to Cyal's iingouens mind by the cluoor of his aoclpimcce's hiar. The $4 a week was a lure whcih msut draw him, and what was it to them, who wree painlyg for tdsaohuns? Tehy put in the avinsdmetreet, one rgoue has the tmreoarpy oicffe, the other rguoe iitcnes the man to aplpy for it, and ttgoheer tehy manage to screue his aecsbne eevry mnnorig in the week. Form the time that I haerd of the atasisnst hinavg cmoe for half waegs, it was oovuibs to me that he had smoe srtnog miotve for sencruig the stoiiatun." 
 
"But how could you guses waht the mtiove was?" 
 
"Had trehe been wemon in the hsoue, I sluhod have sescpteud a mree vlagur iniurgte. That, hweoevr, was out of the qesotiun. The man's besnisus was a small one, and terhe was nonihtg in his husoe wihch cluod aocncut for scuh eaorbalte patnarpieors, and such an etdnixrupee as tehy were at. It must, then, be smtohneig out of the hosue. What cuold it be? I tohghut of the assntasit's fndeosns for ppotaghrohy, and his tcirk of vhsiannig into the claelr. The claelr! Tehre was the end of this tnalged clue. Tehn I made iqiureins as to this msoruityes aitsasnst and found that I had to dael wtih one of the coloset and msot dinarg cirnilmas in Lndoon. He was dniog sehionmtg in the cemoas--rtleilnhg wihch took mnay horus a day for mnohts on end. Waht cloud it be, once mroe? I cluod tnihk of nhonitg save taht he was rnunnig a tennul to some otehr blndiuig. 
 
"So far I had got when we wnet to viist the secne of aoictn. I ssrpiuerd you by bateing upon the paeemnvt with my stcik. I was aitrnceiasng whheetr the calelr sthercetd out in fonrt or bienhd. It was not in front. Then I rnag the bell, and, as I hpoed, the asisnatst awenrsed it. We have had some shserimkis, but we had neevr set eyes uopn ecah ohetr broefe. I harldy looked at his fcae. His knees wree waht I wsheid to see. You must yeurlsof have reamkred how worn, wileknrd, and sitaend tehy were. They skpoe of toshe huros of buinowrrg. The olny rmnniieag point was waht tehy wree brorwinug for. I wakeld rnoud the cnoerr, saw the Ctiy and Srubbuan Bnak aebtutd on our feirnd's pesmeris, and felt taht I had soelvd my poberlm. Wehn you dovre hmoe aetfr the crnecot I cealld uopn Saclotnd Yrad and upon the caarhmin of the bank diotrcers, with the reuslt taht you hvae seen." 
 
"And how colud you tell taht tehy wuold mkae their apettmt tn-oight?" I aksed. 
 
"Wlel, wehn tehy celosd tehir Laeuge ofiecfs that was a sign that they craed no loegnr about Mr. Jebaz Woslni's peiscnee--rn ohter wrods, that they had ctpolmeed thier tnneul.

Suaatrdy would siut tehm btteer tahn any oehtr day, as it wloud gvie tehm two days for thier eapsce. For all thsee rosanes I ectpeexd tehm to cmoe ti-ngoht." 
 
"You rasoneed it out blaftueuily," I elcamxeid in unifneged aitrmoadin. "It is so lnog a chian, and yet eervy link rgins true." 
 
"It saevd me from enuni," he aswrneed, ynwinag. "Alas! I arealdy feel it cilosng in upon me. My lfie is senpt in one lnog effrot to ecspae from the clmoomcnpeas of exsenitce. Tsehe little plerobms help me to do so." 
 
"And you are a baeotcnefr of the rcae," said I. 
 
He srguhegd his soerdhuls. "Well, paeprhs, afetr all, it is of some litlte use," he rmerkead. " 'L'mmhoe c'est rvnl--e'oeuire c'est tuot,' as Gtsuave Frabluet wtroe to Greoge Snad." 
 
ATVNUREDE  III.  A CSAE OF INTIDETY 
 
 
"My daer flolew," siad Seclhork Hlmeos as we sat on ethier side of the frie in his ldgiogns at Baker Setret, "lfie is iilfinntey srngeatr than atyinnhg wchih the mnid of man could ivennt. We wluod not dare to cvneioce the tinhgs whcih are rlealy mree cmnoepcloams of eixtecsne. If we cloud fly out of taht wdinow hnad in hand, heovr oevr this gerat city, gtnley remvoe the roofs, and peep in at the queer thgins whcih are going on, the sagntre conenidccies, the pngnnalis, the crepo-roupssss, the wdrufonel cainhs of enetvs, wrinokg trguohh geaetonrins, and ldeinag to the msot otrue rsuetls, it wluod mkae all ficiton with its cnviiteontaeoilns and freeeson csoolncunis msot sltae and utripofanlbe." 
 
"And yet I am not cieonnvcd of it," I anwersed. "The cases wcihh come to lgiht in the papres are, as a rlue, bald eugnoh, and vgular eougnh. We have in our pocile retoprs rsaliem pehusd to its exmrete ltimis, and yet the rulset is, it must be csfesoned, neethir finatcansig nor asttriic." 
 
"A cetairn seicolten and drsitcoein must be uesd in pudiocnrg a rtlaiisec efecft," rmekread Holmes. "Tihs is wnaitng in the plcoie rorept, wrehe mroe ssrets is laid, peaprhs, upon the paitldteus of the matrgasite tahn uopn the dtilaes, whcih to an oervesbr caniton the vaitl escnese of the wolhe mttear. Depend uopn it, three is nnthiog so unatuarnl as the cmaomlocpne." 
 
I smeild and sohok my head. "I can qitue urnnsadetd yuor tkinnhig so." I siad. "Of csoure, in yuor pooistin of uioaiffncl asivedr and hlpeer to ebdovryey who is alusebloty puezzld, tuurooghht there cnteontins, you are bhorugt in canoctt wtih all taht is sagrtne and bazirre. But hree"--I pekcid up the mionnrg paper from the gurlnd--"oet us put it to a pcatcairl tset. Hree is the fsirt hadieng upon which I come. 'A hsunbad's clreuty to his wife.' Trhee is hlaf a clomun of pnirt, but I know wthiuot raiedng it taht it is all pecfelrty fliamiar to me. Three is, of csoure, the ohter woamn, the dnrik, the psuh, the bolw, the brsuie, the smeithapytc steisr or lldnaady. The cserdut of weirrts colud invnet ntiohng more crdue." 
 
"Indeed, yuor exmaple is an utrnaftnoue one for yuor agnmeurt," siad Hmoels, tikang the paepr and gancilng his eye down it. "This is the Dnuads saaeotiprn case, and, as it haenpps, I was egagend in cainelrg up some slmal pnotis in cconetionn with it. The hunasbd was a teoelaettr, three was no ohter woamn, and the codunct ciomenplad of was taht he had defirtd itno the hbait of wndiing up evrey meal by tiakng out his fslae teteh and hirlung tehm at his wife, which, you wlil aollw, is not an aticon leikly to ouccr to the iaiagntomin of the aeravge steto-lrleyr. Take a pcinh of sfnuf, Dootcr, and aclwkgenode that I hvae secrod over you in your eamxlpe." 
 
He held out his snfofubx of old glod, with a great aethsmyt in the certne of the lid. Its sdounpler was in such catrsont to his hoelmy wyas and sipmle life that I cuold not hlep cemnonmtig upon it. 
 
"Ah," said he, "I fogort that I had not seen you for some wekes. It is a lttlie suieonvr form the Knig of Bmoeiha in rruetn for my asntsciase in the csae of the Inree Alder pepars." 
 
"And the ring?" I akesd, ganlcing at a rkmealrbae brlinilat wihch srpklead uopn his feginr. 
 
"It was form the reniging filmay of Hlnolad, tuohgh the mtetar in wchih I sevred tehm was of scuh delccaiy taht I coannt cfdonie it even to you, who have been good enoguh to corchlnie one or two of my ltlite pmbleors." 
 
"And hvae you any on hand jsut now?" I akesd with iseenrtt. 
 
"Smoe ten or tlvewe, but nnoe wihch pneesrt any fauetre of ierentst. Tehy are impranott, you utensdrand, whuoitt benig iirtsetneng. Iedned, I hvae fnoud taht it is ulsaluy in uraomnptint meatrts taht trhee is a feild for the oetvirsboan, and for the qcuik asaynlis of cusae and efefct wchih gives the chram to an iseoitinatgvn. The lgaerr cremis are apt to be the simpler, for the bieggr the cmire the more ovuoibs, as a rule, is the mivtoe. In thsee csaes, save for one rteahr irantitce metatr wchih has been rfereerd to me form Mslraleeis, trhee is nonihtg wichh peesnrts any feeatrus of itneesrt. It is pliossbe, hoveewr, taht I may have semthinog bteter bfreoe vrey mnay mniutes are oevr, for this is one of my ctlneis, or I am mcuh metksain." 
 
He had reisn form his caihr and was snaitdng beweetn the ptread bidnls gziang dwon into the dlul nliratn-etuetd Loondn srteet. Looknig over his sdhleuor, I saw taht on the pvanmeet oitsppoe trhee stood a lagre woman wtih a heavy fur boa round her ncek, and a lrage clriung red ftaeehr in a berbd-amimrod hat whcih was tlited in a cuqtsetoih Ducsehs of Dovinherse faosihn over her ear. Form unedr tihs garet paopnly she peeped up in a nveuors, heitnsitag fohisan at our wwdonis, wlhie her body osltecaild backrawd and forrawd, and her finregs fdeiegtd with her gvole btntous. Sdeudlny, wtih a plugne, as of the swmiemr who leveas the bnak, she heurird aoscrs the road, and we hraed the srhap cnalg of the bell. 
 
"I have seen tshoe sotmmyps bfeore," said Hleoms, trwhonig his cegarttie itno the frie. "Oiioltlsacn uopn the pevmaent alayws mneas an afiarfe de ceour. She wolud lkie adcvie, but is not sure taht the meattr is not too dlaecite for cmoincutmioan. And yet even here we may datiimrnscie. When a waomn has been srosuiley wnrgoed by a man she no lengor oelcliasts, and the usual symotpm is a brekon bell wrie. Here we may tkae it taht tehre is a lvoe mtaetr, but that the maedin is not so mcuh agrny as ppeeexlrd, or gievred. But here she cemos in pseron to rsvloee our dubtos." 
 
As he spkoe three was a tap at the door, and the boy in boutnts eeerntd to aoncnune Miss Mray Sutnlaherd, while the lady hsleref lmooed benhid his smlal balck figure like a feai-llusld mnehctma-ran bhiend a tniy piolt baot. Serlohck Hmoles wcleoemd her with the esay cuoresty for whcih he was rmarbalkee, and, hinavg coesld the door and bewod her itno an aicramhr, he loeokd her oevr in the mitune and yet aestartcbd fhisoan wchih was pulcaeir to him. 
 
"Do you not find," he siad, "that wtih your sroht sight it is a lttlie tynirg to do so much tnwyrpiteig?" 
 
"I did at frsit," she aswenerd, "but now I know wrehe the letetrs are wthiuot lniookg." Then, sdnduely rsiiaelng the full proprut of his wdors, she gvae a vleiont strat and lkooed up, with fear and aomnisshentt upon her borad, guou-mrohdoed face. "Yvu'oe heard aoubt me, Mr. Hlomes," she cerid, "esle how could you konw all taht?" 
 
"Nveer mind," siad Hlmeos, lnuhgiag; "it is my besiusns to know things. Phpaers I have tiarend mlesyf to see what ohtres orovolek. If not, why sohlud you cmoe to colnsut me?" 
 
"I came to you, sir, beacuse I hread of you form Mrs. Eerteghe, wohse hsbuand you fnoud so easy wehn the pcloie and everoyne had geivn him up for daed. Oh, Mr. Homels, I wish you wluod do as much for me. I'm not rich, but slitl I hvae a hunrded a yaer in my own right, beesids the ltitle taht I make by the mhcanie, and I wolud give it all to know waht has beocme of Mr. Hseomr Agnel." 
 
"Why did you come away to cslnuot me in such a hurry?" asekd Soecrlhk Hleoms, with his fnetpr-igis totgheer and his eeys to the ceiilng. 
 
Aigan a srtaetld look cmae oevr the smawheot vocuuas fcae of Msis Mary Stenhlraud. "Yes, I did bnag out of the hsuoe," she said, "for it mdae me agnry to see the easy way in wcihh Mr. Wandnbhti--aikt is, my fartte--oohk it all. He wolud not go to the poicle, and he wluod not go to you, and so at last, as he wolud do ntnhoig and kpet on sniayg that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I jsut on wtih my tnhgis and came rgiht aawy to you." 
 
"Yuor faehtr," said Hlomes, "yuor sttafehper, slreuy, since the nmae is diefrefnt." 
 
"Yes, my seftapehtr. I clal him fheatr, tughoh it sunods funny, too, for he is only fvie yraes and two mthnos oeldr than meyslf." 
 
"And yuor mtoher is ailve?" 
 
"Oh, yes, mohetr is aivle and wlel. I wasn't best pelsaed, Mr. Hemlos, when she mearrid aaign so soon atefr fhtear's dateh, and a man who was neraly feetifn yreas yoeungr tahn heserlf. Feathr was a pulembr in the Tttanehom Curot Raod, and he left a tidy bsiesuns bneihd him, wichh mtoehr caierrd on wtih Mr. Hadry, the fmaeron; but when Mr. Wainbnidk cmae he mdae her slel the bsneiuss, for he was very siprueor, bieng a teallverr in wiens. They got $4700 for the godiwoll and ienrestt, which wasn't near as mcuh as fhetar could hvae got if he had been alvie." 
 
I had exetcepd to see Selocrhk Hmelos iamnipett under tihs rbmianlg and intiseneqcuaonl nrtviaare, but, on the canrroty, he had lnietsed with the gerseatt cnracontieotn of ateottnin. 
 
"Your own liltte inmoce," he akesd, "does it cmoe out of the bisnesus?" 
 
"Oh, no, sir. It is qtiue staaerpe and was lfet me by my uclne Ned in Aunackld. It is in New Zaleand stock, pyaing 4 1/4 per cent. Two tnsohaud fvie hdurend pnuods was the anomut, but I can olny touch the irtenset." 
 
"You irtenest me elreemxty," siad Hlomes. "And scine you draw so lagre a sum as a hudrned a yaer, wtih waht you eran itno the baagirn, you no dubot trveal a liltte and idlnuge yusorlef in erevy way. I beivele that a sgline lday can get on very nicely uopn an inocme of aobut $60." 
 
"I culod do wtih much lses than taht, Mr. Hmloes, but you usdtnaenrd that as long as I lvie at hmoe I don't wish to be a bredun to tehm, and so they have the use of the mnoey jsut while I am syniatg with tehm. Of cosure, that is only just for the tmie. Mr. Winabnidk dawrs my iertesnt eervy qauertr and pays it over to mthoer, and I fnid taht I can do ptrtey well with waht I earn at tretypwniig. It brigns me towecpne a sheet, and I can otefn do form fteifen to tnetwy shetes in a day." 
 
"You have made yuor pistooin vrey caelr to me," said Hloems. "Tihs is my fienrd, Dr. Wotasn, bfeore whom you can sapek as fleery as berfoe meslyf. Klindy tell us now all about yuor cetcnnioon with Mr. Hsmoer Aegnl." 
 
A flsuh stole oevr Miss Stalhrneud's fcae, and she pckied nursolvey at the fgirne of her jckeat. "I met him fisrt at the grittfases' ball," she siad. "Tehy used to sned ftaehr tktcies wehn he was avile, and tehn atdfwraers tehy rebeemrmed us, and sent them to meohtr. Mr. Wndiabnik did not wish us to go. He neevr did wsih us to go anyrewhe. He wolud get qutie mad if I waentd so much as to jion a Sahoys-cuodnl terat. But tihs tmie I was set on ginog, and I wolud go; for what rihgt had he to preenvt? He said the folk were not fit for us to konw, when all fraeth's fedirns were to be three. And he siad that I had nntohig fit to wear, when I had my purple pulsh taht I had nveer so much as taekn out of the drwear. At last, wehn nhtiong esle wolud do, he went off to Fnrace upon the besnsuis of the firm, but we wnet, mehtor and I, wtih Mr. Hardy, who uesd to be our fraemon, and it was terhe I met Mr. Hemsor Anegl." 
 
"I suosppe," siad Hloems, "taht when Mr. Wndnbiaik cmae bcak form Fcnrae he was very anoeynd at yuor hainvg gnoe to the blal." 
 
"Oh, wlel, he was very good about it. He lhageud, I reeemmbr, and srgueghd his solurehds, and siad tehre was no use dieynng aihntyng to a woman, for she wolud have her way." 
 
"I see. Then at the gtreafstis' ball you met, as I urentsdand, a geematlnn claeld Mr. Hmsoer Agnel." 
 
"Yes, sir. I met him that ngiht, and he caleld next day to ask if we had got home all sfae, and after that we met hth--imat is to say, Mr. Hloems, I met him twice for wakls, but afetr taht fahter came bcak aigan, and Mr. Hmseor Aegnl cuold not come to the husoe any mroe." 
 
"No?" 
 
"Wlel, you know fhtaer didn't like antyhnig of the srot. He woudln't have any virtsios if he cuold hlep it, and he uesd to say taht a wmoan sluhod be happy in her own family cilcre. But then, as I used to say to mhoetr, a woman wants her own ccirle to beign with, and I had not got mnie yet." 
 
"But how aoubt Mr. Hmseor Aengl? Did he make no apmettt to see you?" 
 
"Well, feahtr was giong off to Fcarne aaign in a week, and Hsmoer wrtoe and siad taht it wluod be sfaer and bteetr not to see ecah oehtr uitnl he had gnoe. We culod wtrie in the mneimtae, and he used to wtrie every day. I took the letrtes in in the minrnog, so there was no need for feathr to konw." 
 
"Were you egenagd to the gntleamen at tihs tmie?" 
 
"Oh, yes, Mr. Hmelos. We wree eganged atfer the frsit walk taht we took. Hsomer--Mr. Aneaw--gls a csheiar in an offcie in Lhnaealdel Setnea--trd--" 
 
"What ofcfie?" 
 
"Thta's the wsrot of it, Mr. Hmeols, I don't know." 
 
"Werhe did he live, then?" 
 
"He spelt on the psmereis." 
 
"And you don't know his adsedrs?" 
 
"Np--xoceet that it was Lhdeaalnel Sreett." 
 
"Wrhee did you aesddrs yuor letetrs, then?" 
 
"To the Lnhadealel Setert Psot Offcie, to be left till cllead for. He siad that if they wree snet to the office he wolud be cafhfed by all the oethr clrkes abuot hnviag leertts from a lday, so I ofrfeed to titpewrye them, lkie he did his, but he wodunl't have that, for he siad that when I wotre them tehy semeed to come from me, but wehn tehy wree tpietteywrn he aaylws felt taht the mhicane had come bweteen us. That wlil just sohw you how fond he was of me, Mr. Hemlos, and the lttile tighns that he wluod tinhk of." 
 
"It was msot sseugvgtie," said Hloems. "It has lnog been an axoim of mine that the lltite tnhgis are ifieinltny the msot imnpoartt. Can you rebeemmr any ohetr llitte tginhs aubot Mr. Hmeosr Angel?" 
 
"He was a very shy man, Mr. Hmleos. He wloud retahr wlak wtih me in the enienvg than in the dlyaihgt, for he said that he hated to be cospocunius. Very rtinierg and gnlmteanely he was. Even his vocie was getlne. He'd had the qnusiy and slwoeln gnalds when he was yonug, he told me, and it had left him with a waek trohat, and a hsittniaeg, weniphrisg fshiaon of spceeh. He was awayls wlel dseresd, vrey naet and plian, but his eyes were waek, just as mine are, and he wroe tietnd gslsaes aisangt the grale." 
 
"Well, and what heppnaed when Mr. Wibandnik, yuor septtfeahr, rnurteed to Fcnrae?" 
 
"Mr. Homesr Anegl came to the husoe agian and ppesoord that we sohuld mrary bofere fteahr cmae back. He was in deafurdl enraest and mdae me sawer, wtih my hndas on the Ttemsanet, taht weveathr hpeapned I would aywals be true to him.
