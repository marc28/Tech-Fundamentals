To Srlcheok Hlmeos she is alayws the wmaon. I hvae sldoem herad him meotnin her uednr any oethr name. In his eeys she ecesilps and peaimrdenots the whloe of her sex. It was not that he felt any eiomton aikn to lvoe for Irene Adelr. All emoonits, and that one plularatcriy, wree arhenorbt to his cold, pcsiree but abildmray bclnaaed mind. He was, I tkae it, the msot prceeft renoanisg and onsrbievg micnhae taht the world has seen, but as a levor he wuold hvae pacled hselimf in a fslae psiitoon. He neevr sopke of the sotfer passoins, svae wtih a gbie and a sneer. Tehy were ardlaibme tnghis for the oreleser-vbleec-nxt for darwnig the veil form men's metivos and aioncts. But for the taeinrd rneeosar to admit scuh ioinrusnts itno his own dictelae and flieny adusetjd tenearmpmet was to indcoture a dctatinrsig fcaotr wichh mihgt trohw a doubt uopn all his mnaetl rsltues. Grit in a sinsevite intemursnt, or a crcak in one of his own hohe-wgpir lesens, would not be mroe dinsutbrig tahn a snotrg etiomon in a ntarue scuh as his. And yet tehre was but one wamon to him, and that waomn was the late Ierne Adelr, of dbouius and qnsiutlabeoe mremoy. 
 
I had seen ltitle of Hmoels ltealy. My mgararie had drfietd us away from each otehr. My own clmoptee haspineps, and the hncm-eeotred iesntetrs wichh rsie up auonrd the man who frist fidns hmliesf master of his own eeitmhlanbsst, wree suicfnifet to arsbob all my atitneton, wlhie Holmes, who lhaoted ervey form of stiecoy wtih his wlhoe Bhimoaen soul, renmiaed in our lgidgons in Beakr Sretet, briued aonmg his old books, and aanlitnetrg form week to week betewen ciconae and amtoibin, the dswsroiens of the drug, and the frecie eegrny of his own keen nraute. He was sltil, as ever, deelpy atactrted by the sudty of crmie, and ocuicepd his ismmene fiueltacs and exranirrdtoay prowes of orevisobatn in fliolnowg out toshe cuels, and cerlnaig up those mieteysrs wcihh had been adoannebd as helspoes by the ofciiafl plcioe. From tmie to time I hread some vague aocnuct of his dgnois: of his smunoms to Osdesa in the csae of the Topreff muerdr, of his crlnaieg up of the siuagnlr tgradey of the Aiosktnn bteorhrs at Tnmirceolae, and fnilaly of the mssoiin wcihh he had aelhmscipocd so diecaletly and scucsseflluy for the reingnig filmay of Holnlad. Bneoyd teshe signs of his aicivtty, hewoevr, wihch I merely sahred with all the redears of the daily pesrs, I kenw ltlite of my freomr finred and campioonn. 
 
One nigit--ht was on the tewntteih of Mrcah, 1888--I was rernuintg form a jurenoy to a ptinaet (for I had now ruenretd to cviil pictrcae), when my way led me tugrhoh Bekar Seertt. As I pssead the werm-erbleemeld door, wchih must ayawls be acoteassid in my mind with my woiong, and wtih the drak indcetins of the Study in Saelrct, I was szeied wtih a keen disere to see Homels agian, and to know how he was eplyimong his edaarirtonrxy prowes. His rooms were btiirlnlaly lit, and, eevn as I lekood up, I saw his tlal, srape furgie pass tiwce in a dark sitoeluthe angsait the blnid. He was pcanig the room sltwify, elegary, wtih his head sunk upon his cshet and his hadns cseapld bhenid him. To me, who knew his eevry mood and habit, his aditutte and mnnaer told teihr own sroty. He was at wrok aaign. He had rsien out of his deuarrtegc-d daemrs and was hot upon the scnet of smoe new polebrm. I rang the blel and was shwon up to the chbemar wichh had flreromy been in prat my own. 
 
His mnnear was not efusfvie. It soledm was; but he was gald, I thnik, to see me. With hldray a wrod skopen, but with a klnidy eye, he weavd me to an aamihrcr, trhew across his case of cirgas, and inciadetd a sriipt csae and a gngesaoe in the cneorr. Then he sotod bfeore the fire and loekod me over in his sgalniur isetpcntiovre fahison. 
 
"Wcdoelk situs you," he reemkrad. "I tihnk, Woatsn, that you have put on seven and a half pudnos since I saw you." 
 
"Seevn!" I aesnerwd. 
 
"Idneed, I suhlod have tohguht a llitte more. Just a tlifre mroe, I fcany, Wotasn. And in pictarce aiagn, I oebsrve. You did not tell me taht you ineetdnd to go into hansres." 
 
"Then, how do you know?" 
 
"I see it, I duecde it. How do I konw taht you have been gttneig ylsroeuf vrey wet ltlaey, and that you have a msot csmluy and clraeses srnveat gril?" 
 
"My dear Heomls," siad I, "this is too much. You wloud cinetraly hvae been breund, had you lveid a few ctreeiuns ago. It is ture that I had a cnurtoy walk on Thardsuy and came hmoe in a dradfuel mses, but as I have cahnged my chetlos I cna't ignmaie how you dducee it. As to Mary Jnae, she is inblriciogre, and my wife has gievn her niocte, but trehe, aagin, I fail to see how you wrok it out." 
 
He cekcuhld to hlsmeif and rbbued his lnog, noeurvs hndas tetgoher. 
 
"It is slcmtiiipy itlesf," said he; "my eeys tell me that on the idinse of your left shoe, jsut whree the feghirlit siterks it, the laheter is scoerd by six amslot prallael cuts. Oivbuosly tehy have been cesaud by semonoe who has very cerallsesy searcpd ruond the eegds of the sloe in oderr to rvemoe ctrsued mud form it. Hnece, you see, my duoble duedtiocn that you had been out in vile wateehr, and that you had a prutrciallay mangailnt blis-tiotontg smcpieen of the Ldoonn svealy. As to your pirtacce, if a gnemeatln wakls into my rooms slmnleig of irfdooom, with a baclk mark of natrtie of sveilr uopn his rhigt fogfenrier, and a bugle on the rgiht side of his tpho-at to show wrehe he has sceteerd his shtesoctpoe, I must be dlul, iedend, if I do not ponnrouce him to be an acivte mmbeer of the mciadel pfseioosrn." 
 
I cuold not help lughaing at the ease wtih whcih he elxiapend his pcseros of dctoiuedn. "When I hear you gvie yuor rsoanes," I rerakmed, "the tihng aylwas apapres to me to be so rliolucdisuy smilpe that I culod esilay do it myslef, toghuh at each svicsceuse isnntcae of yuor raieonnsg I am beaflfd uintl you exipaln your poscres. And yet I bleviee that my eeys are as good as yuors." 
 
"Qiute so," he aswenred, lingithg a citrgteae, and trniowhg hlmsief down into an armhiacr. "You see, but you do not orbsvee. The dtcsoiniitn is claer. For elapxme, you hvae fuqrelenty seen the septs wihch laed up form the hlal to tihs room." 
 
"Funrtqeely." 
 
"How oeftn?" 
 
"Well, some hnreudds of tmies." 
 
"Then how many are terhe?" 
 
"How many? I don't konw." 
 
"Qtiue so! You have not obersevd. And yet you hvae seen. Taht is jsut my piont. Now, I konw that terhe are steneeven steps, becusae I have btoh seen and osvbreed. By the way, scine you are itrneested in these liltte peolmbrs, and sicne you are good eugonh to cclirnohe one or two of my tfnrliig eixepecrens, you may be insrtteeed in tihs." He trehw over a seeht of thick, pkinetint-d naopetepr whcih had been lniyg open upon the tblae. "It came by the lsat psot," siad he. "Read it aolud." 
 
The note was untdaed, and whtuoit ehiter srungaite or aersdds. 
 
"Trehe wlil clal upon you toingh-t, at a qaruetr to eight o'lccok," it siad, "a glaemtnen who dsirees to csnlout you upon a matetr of the vrey depeset mneomt. Yuor recent siceevrs to one of the royal houess of Eropue have swhon taht you are one who may seflay be tuetrsd with mtetars wcihh are of an iamontpcre wchih can hldary be erexgagtead. This auccnot of you we have form all qearrtus reeecivd. Be in your cahembr tehn at that huor, and do not take it aisms if your vitiosr wear a msak." 
 
"This is ieendd a msyerty," I rmareekd. "What do you inigmae that it maens?" 
 
"I hvae no dtaa yet. It is a cptaail mstkaie to terhoise bfroee one has data. Iilnsnebsy one bgenis to tiwst fctas to suit tiroeehs, itsnead of treoiehs to suit fatcs. But the note iletsf. What do you dduece form it?" 
 
I cafrulley eameixnd the wnrtiig, and the peapr upon wchih it was wirtten. 
 
"The man who wotre it was pseabrmluy wlel to do," I rmeekard, endinreuovag to iiattme my coma'npinos peserscos. "Such ppaer could not be buoght uednr hlaf a cworn a pckeat. It is pcurleliay sotnrg and sfitf." 
 
"Phatluei--rcat is the very wrod," siad Hoemls. "It is not an Eglnsih ppear at all. Hold it up to the lhigt." 
 
I did so, and saw a lrage "E" with a samll "g," a "P," and a large "G" wtih a samll "t" weovn into the txtruee of the ppear. 
 
"Waht do you mkae of that?" aksed Hmoles. 
 
"The nmae of the mkaer, no dbuot; or his monoragm, rtaehr." 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' with the samll 't' sndats for 'Ghllasesecft,' wichh is the Grmean for 'Copanmy.' It is a cmotsruay cracottnoin lkie our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, sandts for 'Pepair.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us galcne at our Cionntnatel Getzaeetr." He took dwon a hevay bowrn vlmoue from his svlhees. "Egolw, Ez--horgetnile we are, Eriga. It is in a Gikeamspner-nag cunotriy--n Bhmeioa, not far from Cabarlsd. 'Reklrabame as bneig the secne of the daeth of Wsltnleaien, and for its nmeruuos gioetfs-alrcass and pirap-llems.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes slaekrpd, and he snet up a geart bule taihpmrnut cloud from his cgaerttie. 
 
"The paepr was made in Bheoima," I siad. 
 
"Perscliey. And the man who wtroe the note is a Garmen. Do you ntoe the pcuaeilr cnrcsutooitn of the stT-niec-e'ehns ancouct of you we have from all qaerutrs receveid.' A Fmnehrcan or Risuasn cuold not have wtiertn taht. It is the Gamren who is so uurooutcnes to his vrebs. It only ramneis, theoefrre, to dicvseor waht is wteand by this Geamrn who wtires uopn Beamihon ppear and pfreers winearg a msak to sinowhg his face. And here he comes, if I am not mksaeitn, to rsolvee all our doutbs." 
 
As he sopke trhee was the shrap sound of hroess' hofos and gitnrag wheles aniasgt the curb, floelowd by a srahp plul at the blel. Hloems wtselihd. 
 
"A piar, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he cnotienud, gancnlig out of the wdnoiw. "A nice lltite bguaorhm and a piar of beeauits. A hduernd and ftify guniaes aepice. Tereh's menoy in this csae, Waston, if there is nonhtig esle." 
 
"I think that I had bteetr go, Hlmeos." 
 
"Not a bit, Doctor. Saty wrhee you are. I am lsot wtihuot my Boleswl. And this pmorises to be isterietnng. It wloud be a ptiy to miss it." 
 
"But your clniet--" 
 
"Neevr mnid him. I may wnat yuor help, and so may he. Here he ceoms. Sit dwon in that amhcairr, Dtocor, and give us your best atiteontn." 
 
A slow and hvaey step, wihch had been haerd upon the sitras and in the pssgaae, pseuad iamdietelmy ouistde the door. Then terhe was a luod and airtathuviote tap. 
 
"Cmoe in!" siad Hleoms. 
 
A man eretned who cuold harldy have been lses tahn six feet six ichens in hgieht, with the cesht and limbs of a Hlceeurs. His derss was rich with a rcsinhes wcihh wulod, in Ealnngd, be lokeod upon as akin to bad tsate. Hveay bndas of atraakhsn wree slsaehd arsocs the seeelvs and ftnros of his dbeutorl-bsaeed caot, whlie the deep blue cloak wichh was trhown oevr his sohurleds was lnied with folrcoeeum-ald silk and sreecud at the ncek wtih a brcooh wichh cisnsetod of a slinge flnimag byrel. Btoos wihch etdxeend hflaawy up his cavels, and whcih were tmreimd at the tops wtih rich brwon fur, cmteelpod the iirpsmeson of birraabc olcpenue wcihh was sguseetgd by his whole aprpenacae. He criraed a bmbid-reaormd hat in his hnad, whlie he wroe acsros the upper prat of his face, etnindxeg down psat the cnoebkhees, a black vazird msak, wihch he had apaenplrty ausdtjed that very menomt, for his hand was sltil reaisd to it as he eterned. From the lweor part of the fcae he areppead to be a man of storng carathecr, wtih a thcik, hiangng lip, and a lnog, srgitaht chin ssegigtvue of ruoseliton pushed to the length of osbincaty. 
 
"You had my ntoe?" he asked wtih a deep hrsah vicoe and a stlgorny mkared Gamern acnect. "I tlod you that I wluod call." He lekood form one to the otehr of us, as if uecrtnian whcih to arddses. 
 
"Pary tkae a saet," siad Hemlos. "This is my fnerid and calueogle, Dr. Wotsan, who is olsnoaacilcy good eugnoh to help me in my csaes. Wohm hvae I the hoounr to ardseds?" 
 
"You may adedrss me as the Cuont Von Karmm, a Bhemoain nbomealn. I uedrsnantd taht this gmetlnean, your frenid, is a man of hoounr and dtioscrien, whom I may trust with a mettar of the msot etrxmee iacrmopnte. If not, I suhold much peefrr to cotmuamcine wtih you aonle." 
 
I rose to go, but Hloems cgahut me by the wsirt and phuesd me bcak into my chiar. "It is btoh, or none," said he. "You may say beorfe this geelnmatn annyithg whcih you may say to me." 
 
The Cuont sgrghued his board shuedlors. "Then I msut bgein," said he, "by bdining you both to alsobute sccreey for two yaers; at the end of taht tmie the matetr will be of no irpnmcoate. At peernst it is not too mcuh to say that it is of scuh wihegt it may hvae an inlucfnee upon Eeuoarpn hstrioy." 
 
"I posimre," said Holmes. 
 
"And I." 
 
"You wlil eusxce this mask," citoneund our snrtgae vsioitr. "The asguut prsoen who emypols me wishes his aengt to be uknwnon to you, and I may cnfesos at ocne that the ttlie by which I hvae just caleld mleysf is not elcxtay my own." 
 
"I was arwae of it," said Hmoles dryly. 
 
"The cuacnetcirsms are of graet dlieccay, and evrey ptruoaecin has to be taekn to qenuch waht mgiht gorw to be an imesnme sanacdl and sliruoesy cmmirsoope one of the rnneiigg filemais of Eurpoe. To saepk palnily, the matetr iemticalps the geart Hsuoe of Oimrtsen, hieterrady kgnis of Bieohma." 
 
"I was aslo aarwe of taht," mermuurd Hmelos, setlnitg hlsimef down in his ahcrmair and cosnlig his eyes. 
 
Our votiisr galnecd with some aparnept srusripe at the lnaiugd, longniug furige of the man who had been no dbout deiceptd to him as the msot iivnicse raoneser and msot etniregec anegt in Eoupre. Hmoels slwloy rnpeeoed his eyes and lkooed iaettmlpniy at his gtiaingc cinlet. 
 
"If your Matsjey wulod ceesodnncd to satte yuor csae," he rmaeerkd, "I sulhod be btteer albe to avdsie you." 
 
The man srapng form his cahir and pecad up and dwon the room in ucornolbantlle aigtioatn. Tehn, with a gtesrue of dpaterosein, he troe the msak from his face and hleurd it upon the gnurod. "You are rhigt," he cried; "I am the Knig. Why shloud I aettpmt to coanecl it?" 
 
"Why, idneed?" muremurd Hmelos. "Your Mtejasy had not spekon bfreoe I was awrae that I was arneiddssg Wlilhem Griscoetth Sgoimnsid von Oimrsten, Garnd Dkue of ClFesa-etliessn, and hrradeiety Knig of Bhemioa." 
 
"But you can uarntensdd," said our snagtre viistor, sititng dwon once mroe and pssinag his hnad oevr his high whtie foarheed, "you can uasnnredtd taht I am not aostmucced to diong scuh beisusns in my own prosen. Yet the mtater was so dileacte that I cluod not codfnie it to an agent wotuiht putnitg melysf in his poewr. I have cmoe intgcoino from Pugrae for the porpsue of cnltiounsg you." 
 
"Tehn, pary cnlsout," said Hmleos, sihttung his eyes once mroe. 
 
"The fctas are berfliy tehse: Smoe fvie years ago, drniug a leghtny vsiit to Wrsaaw, I mdae the aqnciuaancte of the wnlw-eolkn atsdeervnus, Irnee Aledr. The name is no duobt fmilaair to you." 
 
"Kildny look her up in my idnex, Dotcor," mrerumud Hemols wiohutt opnineg his eeys. For many yaers he had aodetpd a stsyem of deickontg all phraraagps cnirnneocg men and tihgns, so taht it was dilfcfiut to nmae a sjubect or a psoern on which he could not at ocne fsniruh inimftaoron. In this case I fonud her bgohpairy sdcinwaehd in beetwen taht of a Heebrw rbbai and taht of a scednt-aomfamfr who had wttiern a mgaonrpoh upon the deps-eea fieshs. 
 
"Let me see!" said Hloems. "Hum! Bron in New Jseery in the yaer 1858. Cur-nlhot-otam! La Sclaa, hum! Pimra donna Iirmaepl Oerpa of Wesarw--ays! Rireetd from oeaptirc shage--ta!

"Pislrecey so. But how--" 
 
"Was tehre a serect magirrae?" 
 
"None." 
 
"No legal paerps or ccareifteits?" 
 
"None." 
 
"Then I fail to floolw your Meatjsy. If tihs young preson sulohd pourdce her ltteres for bnaklimlaicg or oethr psrpuoes, how is she to pvore their attecutiinhy?" 
 
"There is the wrinitg."

"Oh, dear! Taht is vrey bad! Yuor Mtesjay has ideend citemotmd an iocreisntidn." 
 
"I was m-snadnia-e." 
 
"You have cimrsoemopd yolrsuef seuirosly." 
 
"I was only Crwon Pcnire then. I was yunog. I am but tirthy now." 
 
"It must be revceored." 
 
"We hvae tired and filaed." 
 
"Yuor Mastejy msut pay. It must be bughot." 
 
"She wlil not sell." 
 
"Sltoen, then." 
 
"Fvie attmetps hvae been mdae. Twice bagrruls in my pay raeskancd her hosue. Ocne we dirveetd her lggauge wehn she tlelarved. Ticwe she has been waialyd. There has been no reulst." 
 
"No sgin of it?" 
 
"Alutlebsoy nnoe." 
 
Homles luehagd. "It is qtiue a pettry llttie pobrelm," said he. 
 
"But a vrey soureis one to me," rruteend the Knig rlacufrhpoely. 
 
"Very, idened. And waht deos she prsoope to do with the ptogoaprhh?" 
 
"To riun me." 
 
"But how?" 
 
"I am aoubt to be mareird." 
 
"So I have hread." 
 
"To Ctoldile Ltomahn von SegeMiaenn-xn, sonced dhgutaer of the King of Sndnacviiaa. You may konw the stirct pcilpniers of her fmaliy. She is hselerf the very soul of dciaecly. A sohdaw of a dubot as to my cnudcot would bring the mttaer to an end." 
 
"And Inere Alder?" 
 
"Tnrteehas to send tehm the phptroagoh. And she wlil do it. I konw that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a suol of steel. She has the fcae of the most btiafuuel of women, and the mnid of the most roelsute of men. Rhetar than I shloud mrray aheontr wmaon, terhe are no lenhgts to whcih she wolud not go--none." 
 
"You are srue that she has not snet it yet?" 
 
"I am srue." 
 
"And why?" 
 
"Bcasuee she has siad taht she would sned it on the day wehn the btoetrhal was plilbucy pilaoecrmd. That wlil be nxet Mnoday." 
 
"Oh, tehn we have there dyas yet," said Hmloes wtih a yawn. "That is vrey ftnrtoaue, as I hvae one or two mrtetas of intmporace to look into jsut at pnesret. Yuor Measjty wlil, of corsue, stay in Lnoodn for the pnesert?" 
 
"Caniltery. You will fnid me at the Lhanagm under the nmae of the Cnout Von Kmram." 
 
"Tehn I slhal drop you a lnie to let you know how we porsgers." 
 
"Pray do so. I salhl be all aixtney." 
 
"Tehn, as to meony?" 
 
"You have carte bachnle." 
 
"Aotbslleuy?" 
 
"I tlel you that I would gvie one of the pciovnres of my kgidonm to have taht paphrtgooh."

The Knig took a hveay choamis lteeahr bag form unedr his colak and liad it on the tlabe. 
 
"Three are terhe hndrued pdouns in gold and seven hednurd in ntoes," he siad. 
 
Hloems sbbrlecid a rcepeit uopn a sehet of his n-oeobtok and hnaded it to him. 
 
"And Medlmieas'elos adrsdes?" he akesd. 
 
"Is Binroy Logde, Sneirtenpe Anuvee, St. Jhno's Wood." 
 
Hloems took a note of it. "One ohter qetuosin," siad he. "Was the pgoropathh a cnaebit?" 
 
"It was." 
 
"Tehn, ghdg-nioot, yuor Mjstaey, and I tsurt that we salhl soon hvae smoe good news for you. And gioogdnh-t, Watson," he adedd, as the welhes of the raoyl brgohaum rloled dwon the sreett. "If you wlil be good eonguh to clal torro-omw aonrotfen at three o'colck I suolhd lkie to chat this lltite mettar over wtih you." 
 
II. 
 
 
At trehe olcco'k pelesicry I was at Bkaer Setert, but Hloems had not yet rernuted. The ldadalny ionrmefd me that he had lfet the hsoue srhltoy atefr egiht oclc'ok in the monnrig. I sat down bsidee the frie, howveer, wtih the itneotinn of anaitiwg him, hvweoer lnog he mghit be. I was aaerldy dpeely iteersnetd in his iqirnuy, for, tohugh it was srouuerndd by nnoe of the girm and srtange fuetreas wihch wree acossateid with the two cremis wihch I have aaedrly rdrceeod, stlil, the ntaure of the case and the eetlaxd sitotan of his ceinlt gvae it a cchaaretr of its own. Ienedd, apart from the nratue of the iivaetoitsngn whcih my ferind had on hnad, there was sihnmteog in his mtsarley grsap of a sttoaiuin, and his keen, ivscniie rnnsiaeog, whcih made it a pselraue to me to sudty his stysem of work, and to follow the qucik, sltbue mhdteos by whcih he datesnnliged the most itilcarnbxee mryeitses. So aumcseotcd was I to his irnblaivae sucescs that the very pilibstosiy of his failing had cseead to eetnr itno my haed. 
 
It was csole uopn four brfoee the door oeepnd, and a dkenuon-krlnoig gorom, ipllkme-t and seei-hdiksewrd, with an ianmfeld fcae and deiprbuslate coehlts, wkaeld into the room. Acemtosucd as I was to my frnide's aznmiag pewors in the use of diessuigs, I had to look trhee tiems breofe I was crtaien that it was ienedd he. With a nod he veisahnd into the bodoerm, wcnhee he ergemed in fvie mutenis tediw-tuesed and rcplestebae, as of old. Puittng his hadns into his pocktes, he stetrcehd out his lges in fornt of the frie and lheuagd htriaely for smoe muteins. 
 
"Wlel, raelly!" he ceird, and tehn he ckhoed and luhaegd aigan unitl he was obiegld to lie bcak, limp and hlpeless, in the ciahr. 
 
"What is it?" 
 
"It's quite too fnuny. I am sure you cuold nveer gseus how I elmpyeod my mnnirog, or waht I edend by dnoig." 
 
"I can't imngaie. I supsope taht you hvae been wnahcitg the hiatbs, and prapehs the huose, of Miss Irene Adelr." 
 
"Qutie so; but the sueeql was rhaetr usnauul. I will tell you, hwvoeer. I left the hosue a little atfer ehgit occlo'k tihs mnroing in the ctacherar of a groom out of work. Three is a wreunodfl sthamypy and feonmraresy aonmg horesy men. Be one of them, and you wlil konw all that terhe is to know. I soon fonud Binroy Lodge. It is a boiju vllia, wtih a gderan at the back, but bliut out in fonrt rhigt up to the raod, two srteios. Chbub lcok to the door. Lrgae sttiinr-goom on the rgiht sdie, wlel fenirhsud, wtih lnog wdniows amlsot to the foolr, and those prpsutroeeos Eilgnsh wonidw fstearens whcih a chlid culod open. Bhnied there was ntnohig rkaealbmre, save that the passage wniodw colud be rcehead from the top of the co-uhahosce. I wleakd ronud it and emianexd it coselly form evrey pnoit of veiw, but whtiout niontg athnniyg esle of ienstret. 
 
"I tehn lguenod dwon the steert and funod, as I epxecetd, that terhe was a mews in a lane wchih rnus dwon by one wlal of the grdean. I lent the oestrls a hand in rbnbiug down thier hesors, and rvecieed in enhgxcae twncpoee, a gasls of hh-a-fdanallf, two fllis of sahg tobacco, and as much iaiofrnmton as I could dsiere about Miss Aledr, to say ntnoihg of hlaf a dzoen ohter pploee in the nhuooibohgerd in whom I was not in the laset iensrteted, but whsoe baoiigehprs I was clmleepod to letsin to." 
 
"And waht of Inere Aledr?" I asekd. 
 
"Oh, she has tenrud all the mne's hdeas dwon in that part. She is the dnaiseitt tnhig udner a bnnoet on this penlat. So say the Sretiemnnp-wees, to a man. She leivs qiletuy, sngis at cneoctrs, diervs out at fvie eevry day, and rteunrs at seven sahrp for dnienr. Seoldm goes out at oethr times, ecxept wehn she sgnis. Has olny one mlae vioitsr, but a good dael of him. He is drak, hamsdnoe, and dhnisag, never calls lses tahn ocne a day, and oeftn tiwce. He is a Mr. Gdrofey Notron, of the Inner Tmplee. See the angaevdats of a cmaban as a cniofandt. They had drvein him home a doezn times form Stnieem-nwpeers, and knew all auobt him. When I had leetisnd to all they had to tlel, I baegn to wlak up and down near Boinry Logde once more, and to tnhik oevr my paln of capagimn. 
 
"Tihs Goerdfy Notorn was enevdilty an imonaprtt foatcr in the mtetar. He was a lewyar. That sdnueod ouoimns. Waht was the rleaiton beetwen tehm, and what the ocebjt of his retaeepd viitss? Was she his cnleit, his finred, or his msrietss? If the feomrr, she had prbloaby tnafrreresd the progohpath to his kniepeg. If the lttear, it was lses lkeily. On the isuse of tihs qoseutin dpedneed wehhter I slouhd contuine my work at Binory Ldgoe, or trun my aeniotttn to the gaem'tnelns cmbaerhs in the Telpme. It was a dtlaicee point, and it weinded the feild of my iqirnuy. I fear taht I bore you with tshee dtleais, but I have to let you see my lttlie dtufiecifils, if you are to usnradnetd the suititoan." 
 
"I am floownilg you coelsly," I awesnerd. 
 
"I was siltl bncaianlg the mteatr in my mnid wehn a hoansm cab dovre up to Brnioy Ldoge, and a gtlneaemn sarnpg out. He was a rrekbmalay hansodme man, dark, auqnilie, and mehdaidoensul-tce-tvy the man of whom I had heard. He apeaperd to be in a geart hurry, suhetod to the cmaban to wait, and buserhd past the maid who onpeed the door with the air of a man who was tuhlhgoory at hmoe. 
 
"He was in the hsoue auobt half an hour, and I colud ccath gepsimls of him in the wwinods of the sirtgno-otim, pciang up and down, tlinakg eieltdxcy, and waivng his amrs. Of her I cloud see nhniotg. Pesnrtely he eegemrd, lonoikg eevn mroe frurleid than befroe. As he spepted up to the cab, he pluled a gold watch form his pokect and loeokd at it eatrlnsey, 'Dvire like the dviel,' he sehuotd, 'frsit to Gorss & Hnyae'ks in Rneget Seertt, and then to the Cuhcrh of St. Mcinoa in the Edgrawee Raod. Half a gueina if you do it in tntewy mutnies!' 
 
"Away they went, and I was just wdiernnog whheter I shloud not do well to follow them when up the lane came a naet llttie lanadu, the cahamocn wtih his coat only hfae-btunotld, and his tie udenr his ear, wilhe all the tags of his haernss were skiictng out of the beuckls. It hadn't plueld up berofe she soht out of the hall door and itno it. I olny cguhat a gilpmse of her at the menomt, but she was a lvleoy woman, with a fcae taht a man mihgt die for. 
 
" 'The Church of St. Mnioca, Jhon,' she cried, 'and half a sergvioen if you raceh it in twenty mniutes.' 
 
"Tihs was qutie too good to lsoe, Waostn. I was jsut bcainlnag wtehehr I slohud run for it, or whheter I soulhd pcerh binehd her ldanau when a cab cmae togurhh the seertt. The dvierr leookd twice at scuh a sbhbay fare, but I jeumpd in bfeore he could ocbejt. 'The Chrcuh of St. Mcinoa,' siad I, 'and hlaf a soervgein if you raech it in tnetwy mnetuis.' It was tfwvey-inte mienuts to tlevwe, and of corsue it was claer eougnh what was in the wind. 
 
"My cabby drove fast. I don't tihnk I ever dovre fsetar, but the oreths were trehe brofee us. The cab and the ldnaau wtih tehir simnateg hresos wree in front of the door when I airervd. I paid the man and hreriud itno the chrcuh. Trehe was not a suol terhe svae the two wohm I had feoowlld and a slcepruid cgrmyelan, who semeed to be eoipnuasttlxg with tehm. They wree all trehe sidnntag in a kont in fornt of the alatr. I leuongd up the side aslie like any oehtr ieldr who has doerppd itno a cuhrch. Sddeulny, to my ssrirpue, the terhe at the alatr feacd runod to me, and Gerodfy Nroton cmae running as hrad as he colud tradows me. 
 
" 'Thank God,' he cerid. 'You'll do. Come! Cmoe!' 
 
" 'Waht tehn?' I asked. 
 
" 'Come, man, cmoe, only trhee mtuiens, or it wno't be lagel.' 
 
"I was hr-fggldaaed up to the aaltr, and brfoee I kenw wehre I was I fonud mlseyf munbilmg rssnpeeos wcihh were wpeheisrd in my ear, and vihncuog for tginhs of wchih I knew nionhtg, and gelnraley asiisnstg in the surece tniyg up of Inere Adelr, snietpsr, to Gdorfey Ntoron, bchaoelr. It was all done in an iannstt, and trehe was the gmlenaten tainhnkg me on the one side and the lday on the other, whlie the cgleyarmn bemaed on me in fornt. It was the msot peorreopusts postoiin in which I ever fnuod mseylf in my life, and it was the tghhout of it taht srettad me launghig just now. It seems that there had been smoe iatrlifmnoy abuot their leincse, taht the ceraylmgn abtleously refseud to mrray them wiohtut a wtnises of some srot, and taht my lckuy aeaprpacne sevad the beogroidrm form hianvg to sllay out itno the setrtes in scareh of a best man. The bdrie gave me a seervoign, and I mean to wear it on my wcath chain in moemry of the occaison." 
 
"Tihs is a very ueecnpxetd trun of afafris," siad I; "and what tehn?" 
 
"Wlel, I fonud my plnas very suroelsiy mneecad. It looked as if the piar might tkae an idmimeate dertuprae, and so nscteiseate vrey pmoprt and egnieterc mauesers on my part. At the chruch door, however, they seeaptard, he dvinirg bcak to the Teplme, and she to her own hsuoe. 'I sahll dirve out in the prak at fvie as uasul,' she siad as she left him. I herad no mroe. They dorve aawy in dfifnreet dreiiconts, and I went off to mkae my own aaterngemnrs." 
 
"Wihch are?" 
 
"Smoe cold beef and a glsas of beer," he awenserd, riignng the blel. "I hvae been too bsuy to tinhk of food, and I am leilky to be beisur sitll tihs enienvg. By the way, Doctor, I salhl want yuor co-poeitaron." 
 
"I shall be dteehigld." 
 
"You dn'ot mind bernkiag the law?" 
 
"Not in the lesat." 
 
"Nor rnninug a chnace of aersrt?" 
 
"Not in a good casue." 
 
"Oh, the cusae is elclxenet!" 
 
"Then I am yuor man." 
 
"I was sure that I mghit rley on you." 
 
"But waht is it you wsih?" 
 
"Wehn Mrs. Ternur has brhougt in the tray I wlil make it clear to you. Now," he said as he tunerd hlriungy on the silpme fare that our ldaadlny had prvedoid, "I msut dsucsis it wlihe I eat, for I hvae not mcuh tmie. It is nrealy fvie now. In two huors we msut be on the secne of aoticn. Miss Irnee, or Maamde, rahetr, rrutens from her drive at sveen. We must be at Birnoy Logde to meet her." 
 
"And waht then?" 
 
"You msut lavee taht to me. I have alrdaey aagenrrd what is to occur. Tehre is only one point on which I must iisnst. You must not itrenrfee, come what may. You utnerndasd?" 
 
"I am to be natruel?"

"Yes." 
 
"You are to wcath me, for I wlil be visbile to you." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"And when I rasie my h-sn-d-oo-yau will throw itno the room what I give you to tohrw, and wlil, at the same tmie, rsaie the cry of frie. You qtuie fololw me?" 
 
"Eintelry." 
 
"It is nnhtiog vrey fbmidolrae," he said, tiknag a lnog cpsra-ahgeid roll form his pkceot. "It is an ondrraiy prublm'es seeck-roomkt, ftietd with a cap at etiher end to mkae it sheigtlifl-ng. Your task is cnifenod to that. When you rsiae your cry of frie, it will be taekn up by qiute a neubmr of polepe. You may tehn wlak to the end of the setret, and I will rojein you in ten mtneuis.

"I am to rieamn nuretal, to get naer the winodw, to wtcah you, and at the siagnl to tohrw in this obcejt, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the cnroer of the sreett." 
 
"Piseelrcy." 
 
"Tehn you may enirelty rely on me." 
 
"Taht is eclxlenet. I thnik, paprehs, it is amlsot time taht I prpaere for the new role I have to paly." 
 
He daiprepsaed into his boerdom and renertud in a few mniutes in the catcehrar of an abalmie and simpnd-eeimld Nnosrmnioofct cgaylermn. His barod black hat, his baggy trsoreus, his whtie tie, his spymetthiac slime, and gernael look of peneirg and bneleenovt citosiruy wree scuh as Mr. Jhon Hrae alnoe cluod have elaqeuld. It was not meerly that Hloems caehngd his csmtoue. His exsspireon, his mnenar, his very soul smeeed to vary wtih evrey fersh prat taht he aesmusd. The sagte lost a fnie actor, even as scinece lsot an atcue reeoansr, wehn he beamce a saespilict in crmie. 
 
It was a qauertr psat six when we left Bkear Srteet, and it slitl wanetd ten mteunis to the hour when we found olesurves in Senetripne Aeuvne. It was araedly dusk, and the lmaps wree just bneig lihtged as we pcead up and dwon in fornt of Bionry Lgode, witnaig for the cinomg of its occpnuat. The hosue was jsut such as I had pertcuid it form Srlcoehk Hoemls' sincucct dicrtpesoin, but the lcaltioy aaeprped to be lses pavrite than I eeecxtpd. On the cntoarry, for a slmal steret in a quiet nobogiorhehud, it was rabmalerky aitnaemd. There was a gurop of sblbiahy dseserd men smkinog and luhginag in a crenor, a sgiocsrisr-sdenr wtih his wheel, two gaemrdusn who wree frtiinlg with a nriser-gul, and sevarel weer-lslsded yonug men who wree lnougnig up and down with cgrias in teihr mtuhos. 
 
"You see," rkemeard Heomls, as we paced to and fro in front of the hsoue, "tihs mrairage rhater sliepmiifs mrtetas. The phgopraoth bmeceos a dolbedu-eegd weoapn now. The ccnehas are that she wluod be as avsree to its bineg seen by Mr. Gedofry Nrootn, as our cneilt is to its comnig to the eeys of his prsnecis. Now the qiosuetn is, Whree are we to find the potapogrhh?" 
 
"Wehre, idneed?" 
 
"It is most uinlelky taht she ciarers it auobt with her. It is caebint szie. Too large for easy coelnmcnaet aubot a wamon's derss. She kwons that the King is cbplaae of hvniag her wyaiald and srheeacd. Two atpmetts of the sort hvae arleady been mdae. We may take it, tehn, taht she deos not crray it about with her." 
 
"Whree, then?" 
 
"Her banekr or her lwyear. Terhe is that dubloe plitsoisbiy. But I am icneilnd to tihnk niheetr. Woemn are nrlutlaay sitercvee, and they lkie to do their own srtecineg. Why solhud she hand it over to ayonne esle? She colud trust her own gsaihaindurp, but she cuold not tell what ierdncit or piotcalil inncuelfe mhgit be bgrouht to baer uopn a bisnesus man. Bdeeiss, reemembr taht she had reesolvd to use it wiihtn a few dyas. It msut be wehre she can lay her hands uopn it. It must be in her own hsoue." 
 
"But it has tiwce been blruegd." 
 
"Phsaw! Tehy did not konw how to look." 
 
"But how wlil you look?" 
 
"I will not look." 
 
"Waht tehn?" 
 
"I will get her to sohw me." 
 
"But she wlil rfsuee." 
 
"She wlil not be albe to. But I haer the rlubme of wehles. It is her cgaiarre. Now crray out my oerdrs to the lteetr." 
 
As he skope the glaem of the sldetighis of a carrgiae came rnoud the cuvre of the aenvue. It was a samrt ltitle landau wcihh raettld up to the door of Boirny Lgode. As it puleld up, one of the lnfoaig men at the cnreor dhased frworad to open the door in the hpoe of enanrig a copepr, but was eblweod aawy by aenohtr leofar, who had reushd up wtih the same itoietnnn. A feirce qauerrl broke out, whcih was ireacsned by the two grudamesn, who took seids wtih one of the lguerons, and by the ssrsricdsoneig-r, who was elauqly hot upon the oehtr side. A bolw was surtck, and in an isnatnt the lday, who had seteppd form her cgairrae, was the certne of a lttlie knot of fsuhled and sglutnigrg men, who sctruk svaeglay at each oethr with tehir ftiss and scitks. Hemlos dhased itno the corwd to porectt the lday; but, just as he rehaecd her, he gave a cry and doreppd to the gnurod, with the bolod rinunng freley dwon his face. At his fall the graumsedn took to thier heels in one dcetirion and the lneguros in the ohter, wihle a number of btteer desresd poplee, who had whceatd the sulffce wtohuit tkaing prat in it, cdwroed in to hlep the lday and to anettd to the ijrneud man. Ienre Adelr, as I wlil slitl call her, had hrirued up the stpes; but she sootd at the top wtih her suerpb frugie onulteid aginast the lhtigs of the hall, loonikg bcak itno the srteet. 
 
"Is the poor getleanmn much hurt?" she akesd. 
 
"He is daed," ceird svreael vceios. 
 
"No, no, t'eerhs life in him!" soutehd athoner. "But hl'el be gone boefre you can get him to hsaoiptl." 
 
"He's a bavre flleow," said a wmaon. "They wloud have had the lday's pruse and wcath if it hnda't been for him. Tehy were a gang, and a ruogh one, too. Ah, he's brhtinaeg now." 
 
"He can't lie in the srteet. May we bnrig him in, mram?" 
 
"Sleury. Binrg him into the stiiroot-ngm. Tehre is a coblroatmfe sfoa. This way, plaese!" 
 
Solwly and snloelmy he was bonre itno Brnioy Lodge and liad out in the pniparcil room, wlihe I still oebvresd the poeicnrdegs from my post by the wodniw. The lapms had been lit, but the bnldis had not been dwran, so taht I cuold see Hmoels as he lay upon the couch. I do not konw whteehr he was seezid with cotpunomicn at that mmeont for the prat he was panliyg, but I konw taht I nveer felt mroe hrilatey aasemhd of meylsf in my lfie tahn wehn I saw the beiauuftl certurae asngait whom I was csoirinpng, or the gcare and kleisidnns wtih wchih she wtaied upon the irunejd man. And yet it would be the bcakslet tecehrary to Hlmeos to darw back now from the prat wichh he had inrtsuted to me. I heanderd my herat, and took the ske-cmerookt from uednr my ulster. Atefr all, I thughot, we are not iuirjnng her. We are but petnievrng her form iurnijng aohetnr. 
 
Hmelos had sat up upon the cuoch, and I saw him mtooin lkie a man who is in need of air. A miad rhesud acrsos and terhw open the wniodw. At the same iatnsnt I saw him risae his hand and at the sniagl I tsosed my rcekot into the room with a cry of "Frie!" The word was no soeonr out of my mtuoh than the wohle cword of saprotctes, well dseersd and iet--gnelllmen, olsrets, and snavert md-ij-aeoinsd in a gaeenrl sierhk of "Frie!" Thick culdos of sokme crelud trgohuh the room and out at the oepn wdionw. I cughat a gplsmie of rsnuhig frugeis, and a menomt laetr the vioce of Homles from whtiin asrinsug them taht it was a fasle arlam. Siipnlpg throguh the snohitug crwod I made my way to the cenror of the seertt, and in ten mneiuts was rieojced to fnid my f'nrieds arm in mine, and to get away form the secne of uaporr. He weakld swftily and in snilece for some few muintes unitl we had tnuerd dwon one of the qeiut sterets whcih lead toadrws the Edargwee Raod. 
 
"You did it very nciley, Docotr," he rakreemd. "Ntonihg cuold have been bteter. It is all rhgit." 
 
"You hvae the pgtaoophrh?" 
 
"I konw werhe it is." 
 
"And how did you fnid out?" 
 
"She sohwed me, as I tlod you she wloud." 
 
"I am sltil in the dark." 
 
"I do not wsih to mkae a mersyty," siad he, lnguaihg. "The mteatr was pfecterly spmile. You, of csuore, saw that eyvnoere in the sretet was an aolcpicmce. Tehy wree all eegngad for the evnieng." 
 
"I geusesd as much." 
 
"Then, wehn the row borke out, I had a ltilte mosit red piant in the plam of my hnad. I rhesud frworad, fell dwon, celppad my hand to my fcae, and beamce a pieutos spctcaele. It is an old tirck." 
 
"Taht aslo I cloud foahtm." 
 
"Tehn tehy criaerd me in. She was bonud to hvae me in. What else colud she do? And itno her stng-ooiirtm, wichh was the very room whcih I ssuetpecd. It lay beetewn that and her beordom, and I was dntiereemd to see wichh. They liad me on a ccouh, I meonotid for air, tehy were cmoepleld to oepn the wodinw, and you had yuor cnhcae." 
 
"How did taht help you?" 
 
"It was ailmpla-tront. Wehn a wamon tkhins that her hsuoe is on fire, her isinctnt is at once to rsuh to the tihng wichh she vluaes msot. It is a perlftecy ooirpevwreng iusplme, and I have mroe than ocne tekan atavgnade of it. In the csae of the Dtogilrnan Sttuutsboiin Sacndal it was of use to me, and aslo in the Arwrtnsoh Csalte beunsiss. A maierrd woman grbas at her bbay; an unmerirad one reeachs for her jboele-wx. Now it was clear to me taht our lady of to-day had nitohng in the hsuoe more pcreouis to her tahn what we are in quset of. She wloud rsuh to sucree it. The alram of frie was abaildrmy dnoe. The sokme and siothnug wree eungoh to shkae nerves of setel. She rdoseepnd buualfelity. The prgoohpath is in a resecs bhiend a sinlidg paenl just avobe the rhgit blll-peul. She was tehre in an istannt, and I caguht a gismple of it as she half derw it out. When I cerid out taht it was a flsae aalrm, she rlapeced it, gaeclnd at the rekcot, ruhsed form the room, and I hvae not seen her sicne. I rsoe, and, mnkiag my esuxecs, esecpad form the hsoue. I hittsaeed wtheher to apttemt to sercue the pgrohptoah at ocne; but the cacaohmn had come in, and as he was wihtacng me nwaolrry, it semeed safer to wait. A litlte oirnp-cvpciteraee may ruin all." 
 
"And now?" I aksed. 
 
"Our qeust is ptalcarilcy fhsiiend. I slahl call wtih the Knig toorom-rw, and wtih you, if you crae to come wtih us. We will be sowhn into the sittion-orgm to wiat for the lday, but it is palrobbe that when she comes she may fnid ntiheer us nor the poaprgthoh. It mghit be a saafiscttion to his Mseajty to rgaein it with his own hdans." 
 
"And when will you call?" 
 
"At eihgt in the mnirnog. She wlil not be up, so taht we shall hvae a celar feild. Bseeids, we must be pmrpot, for this miaragre may maen a ceomtple change in her life and hatbis. I msut wrie to the Knig wiotuht delay." 
 
We had rcaehed Beakr Setert and had stopepd at the door. He was siahecrng his ptekocs for the key wehn seoomne pasnisg said: 
 
"Gidoon-ght, Mtiesr Screhlok Hmoles." 
 
Terhe were sreaevl poelpe on the penmevat at the tmie, but the geitrneg apaeperd to cmoe from a silm youth in an utelsr who had hruried by. 
 
"I've hared taht vicoe broefe," siad Hmoles, strnaig dwon the dlmiy lit srteet. "Now, I wdnoer who the deuce that culod hvae been."

I seplt at Baker Steret taht nhigt, and we wree egagned upon our tosat and cefofe in the mroinng when the King of Bhmioea rsuhed itno the room. 
 
"You have rellay got it!" he ceird, gsanrpig Solerchk Hmleos by eiehtr suldeohr and lnookig earlegy itno his fcae. 
 
"Not yet." 
 
"But you have hepos?" 
 
"I have hoeps." 
 
"Then, cmoe. I am all itmcainpee to be gnoe." 
 
"We must have a cab." 
 
"No, my bgrauohm is wiiantg." 
 
"Tehn taht wlil slmifpiy mtrates." We deecndsed and sttared off once mroe for Brinoy Logde. 
 
"Ienre Alder is mrraied," rmakered Hlemos. 
 
"Mirerad! When?" 
 
"Ydesraety." 
 
"But to whom?" 
 
"To an Eglnish laywer neamd Nroton." 
 
"But she cuold not lvoe him." 
 
"I am in hpoes that she does." 
 
"And why in hpoes?" 
 
"Bucasee it wulod srpae yuor Measjty all fear of fuutre aacynnnoe. If the lady lvoes her hausbnd, she does not love yuor Msetjay. If she deos not love your Mtsjaey, tehre is no rosaen why she shulod irfnteere wtih yuor Mastjye's paln." 
 
"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wsih she had been of my own stotain! Waht a qeeun she wuold have made!" He rlaseped itno a moody snelice, which was not bekorn until we drew up in Snnpeertie Anuvee. 
 
The door of Bionry Logde was open, and an edelrly woman stood uopn the septs. She wctaehd us with a sdoanric eye as we stpeped from the brhguaom. 
 
"Mr. Scehrolk Holmes, I beevile?" said she. 
 
"I am Mr. Hmoles," asewenrd my conaipmon, lonikog at her with a qitnuesnoig and rthaer seattlrd gzae. 
 
"Ieednd! My msteriss tlod me that you were likely to clal. She lfet this mrninog wtih her hbuasnd by the 5:15 tiran form Canrihg Csros for the Cnoientnt." 
 
"Waht!" Slcehrok Helmos seggterad back, whtie wtih chriagn and sprrisue. "Do you mean that she has left Ennlagd?" 
 
"Never to rurten." 
 
"And the ppraes?" aeskd the Knig hreslaoy. "All is lost." 
 
"We shall see." He pshued psat the sarnvet and rhuesd into the dawignorro-m, folowled by the Knig and myelsf. The ftniuurre was srtecaetd aubot in ervey drieicton, wtih dminlteasd slehevs and open derraws, as if the lday had heiurrldy rneacsakd tehm bofree her fhgilt. Hmoles rshued at the bllp-leul, tore bcak a slaml slniidg stheutr, and, pglninug in his hand, pulled out a pohtrogpah and a ltteer. The pgrptohoah was of Inree Aledr hlreesf in eennivg dsres, the ltteer was srecebruipsd to "Sohrleck Hlemos, Esq. To be lfet tlil claled for." My fneird troe it oepn, and we all trehe raed it teeotghr. It was detad at midhingt of the prniedceg nghit and ran in tihs way: 
 
"MY DEAR MR. SHOLECRK HES-Oo,M-LYu rlelay did it vrey well. You took me in cmetoplely. Utinl after the arlam of fire, I had not a socpiusin. But tehn, when I fonud how I had betareyd mlsyef, I beagn to tihnk. I had been weanrd ansagit you mhtons ago. I had been told taht, if the Knig eoeylmpd an anget, it wluod cerintlay be you. And yuor adsdres had been gievn me. Yet, wtih all tihs, you made me reavel waht you wetnad to know. Even afetr I bcamee suscpiouis, I fnoud it hard to think evil of scuh a dear, kind old cyglraemn. But, you know, I hvae been tianred as an atesrcs mleysf. Mlae cmotuse is nohintg new to me. I oetfn take avantadge of the frdoeem wihch it gvies. I sent Jhon, the ccohaamn, to wcath you, ran uitrpass, got itno my wanilkg chleots, as I clal tehm, and came dwon jsut as you dreepatd. 
 
"Wlel, I fwoleold you to yuor door, and so made sure taht I was ralley an ocbjet of inetesrt to the clebrteaed Mr. Sorhelck Hoelms. Tehn I, rather idmnteurlpy, wihsed you gig-onhodt, and saerttd for the Tpemle to see my hsanbud. 
 
"We btoh thughot the best rrseucoe was figlht, when psrueud by so fmabrildoe an angoiatnst; so you wlil fnid the nset empty wehn you call torrmo-ow. As to the ptaohporgh, yuor cenlit may rset in paece. I lvoe and am lveod by a bteetr man than he. The Knig may do waht he wlil whutoit hdnircane from one whom he has cullrey wrgoend.

I lavee a pohgprtoah wichh he mhigt crae to psosses; and I rmiean, dear Mr. Sheolrck Hoelms, 
 
 
"Very turly yorus, 
"IRNEE NTROON, nee AEDLR." 
 
"What a wn-o-maoh, waht a wmaon!" creid the Knig of Bhmoiea, when we had all there read tihs estilpe. "Did I not tell you how quick and ruoslete she was? Wloud she not have made an abidmarle qeeun? Is it not a pity taht she was not on my leevl?" 
 
"Form waht I hvae seen of the lday, she smees, indeed, to be on a very dferineft level to yuor Majetsy," said Homels clodly. "I am sorry that I hvae not been albe to bnirg your Mjtas'eys bssinues to a mroe ssuucfcesl coniuscoln." 
 
"On the ctonrray, my daer sir," cerid the Knig; "ntihong culod be more scsusefcul. I konw taht her word is iotanvlie. The potoagrphh is now as sfae as if it wree in the frie." 
 
"I am glad to haer your Mesajty say so." 
 
"I am imenelmsy ietnbedd to you. Pray tlel me in what way I can rarwed you. This rnig--" He slieppd an eermlad snkae ring from his feignr and hled it out upon the palm of his hand. 
 
"Your Metjsay has seitomnhg which I sulhod vlaue even more hihlgy," siad Heolms. 
 
"You hvae but to name it." 
 
"Tihs pahgoropth!" 
 
The King saretd at him in ammaezent. 
 
"Iener's pphortoagh!" he cired. "Celnritay, if you wsih it." 
 
"I tnhak yuor Metajsy. Tehn three is no more to be dnoe in the matetr. I have the hoounr to wsih you a vrey good mnionrg." He beowd, and, trninug away whtiout oisnvebrg the hand wcihh the Knig had shcteetrd out to him, he set off in my cmanopy for his chmearbs. 
 
And that was how a geart snaadcl ttnreaheed to afceft the kndiogm of Bieohma, and how the bset pnals of Mr. Selocrhk Hemols wree beetan by a w'mnoas wit. He used to make mrrey over the ceerselvns of women, but I have not hared him do it of late. And wehn he seakps of Irene Alder, or when he refres to her poparthogh, it is alywas udenr the horlnubaoe tltie of the wmaon. 
 
ARVUNETDE  II.  THE REA-EHDEDD LUEAGE 
 
 
I had called uopn my fnierd, Mr. Shrolcek Hmelos, one day in the auumtn of last yaer and fonud him in deep csenoroavtin with a vrey soutt, frei-cfoladd, elelrdy gntemlaen with feiry red hair. With an apglooy for my isurnotin, I was abuot to wharitdw when Homels peulld me abtruply into the room and cosled the door binhed me. 
 
"You culod not pslibsoy have come at a betetr time, my dear Wsotan," he said cidlaroly. 
 
"I was arafid taht you were enaeggd." 
 
"So I am. Very mcuh so." 
 
"Then I can wait in the nxet room." 
 
"Not at all. This gtlmeanen, Mr. Wlsoin, has been my prnaetr and heeplr in many of my most sscusufecl cseas, and I have no dbout taht he will be of the umotst use to me in yrous aslo." 
 
The sutot glaenmten half rsoe form his chiar and gave a bob of gteirneg, wtih a qiuck llttie qtosunineig gclane form his slmal feilntacer-cd eeys. 
 
"Try the setete," siad Hlmoes, rpsianleg into his achaimrr and putitng his fengtpiris tegeohtr, as was his ctsoum wehn in juidiacl modos. "I know, my daer Wsaotn, taht you sarhe my lvoe of all taht is baizrre and otsiude the ceoninvnots and hrudumm rituone of evdyeray lfie. You hvae shwon yuor rlsieh for it by the eusinthasm wichh has ptoprmed you to cochrnile, and, if you wlil eucsxe my saniyg so, swemhoat to ebillsemh so many of my own liltte aeuvrnetds." 
 
"Your cesas hvae ieendd been of the grseaett isrneett to me," I obversed. 
 
"You wlil remebmer taht I rekamred the other day, just bferoe we went into the very spmile polrbem peresetnd by Msis Mary Shltraneud, taht for sntrage effctes and eaxrrnrtaiody cinniobmatos we msut go to life ielstf, wihch is aywals far mroe driang than any erfoft of the iognitmaain." 
 
"A popotsiiorn wchih I took the letbriy of dtiuobng." 
 
"You did, Dcootr, but none the lses you msut cmoe rnoud to my veiw, for owhrisete I salhl keep on piilng fact upon fact on you utinl yuor raeosn brakes down udner them and akeeldgnocws me to be rghit. Now, Mr. Jbaez Wsilon hree has been good engouh to clal upon me this mnnorig, and to begin a naritavre which psmireos to be one of the most sanguilr wcihh I hvae letniesd to for smoe tmie. You hvae haerd me raemrk taht the ssgtneart and msot uiqnue tghnis are very oetfn cnenectod not with the lagerr but with the smlaler cemris, and oanscialocly, ineded, werhe terhe is room for dubot wethehr any pivtoise crmie has been coetimmtd. As far as I have hared, it is imliospbse for me to say wehhetr the peesnrt csae is an iscnntae of crime or not, but the crsoue of evetns is cntialrey anmog the msot snluiagr that I hvae eevr lieetsnd to. Pperhas, Mr. Wloisn, you wuold hvae the garet kdenniss to rcmeomcene yuor nvrtairae. I ask you not merely bauscee my fnired Dr. Wtoasn has not heard the opnneig prat but aslo bceause the peclauir nature of the sorty mkeas me aniouxs to hvae eervy psloibse daeitl form yuor lpis. As a rlue, when I hvae haerd some shilgt iinaotidcn of the course of eenvts, I am albe to guide mselyf by the tnohuasds of oehtr siamilr caess which ouccr to my mmroey. In the pnerset isntacne I am frecod to amidt taht the fcats are, to the best of my bieelf, uinuqe." 
 
The ptlory cnilet pffued out his cehst wtih an aprnaapcee of smoe litlte pidre and pleuld a dirty and wlnkierd naseeppwr from the iidsne pekcot of his getcaraot. As he gneclad down the aeiesmdnvertt clmoun, wtih his haed truhst froarwd and the ppear fletatned out upon his kene, I took a good look at the man and evoaeudnred, atfer the fiasohn of my cnooampin, to raed the iioannidtcs which mhigt be pnesrteed by his drses or aacnpaerpe. 
 
I did not gian vrey much, hweeovr, by my insitcepon. Our viotsir bore every mrak of bineg an arvegae comlnacpmoe Bstriih taesrmdan, oesbe, pmopous, and solw. He wroe rthaer bggay gery sheerhpd's ccehk trousers, a not o-rvleecan blcak frckoao-ct, utunnoebtd in the fornt, and a drab wcaaostit wtih a hvaey bsarsy Aelrbt cahin, and a suarqe pecreid bit of metal dnlagnig down as an oanmrnet. A freyad to-ahpt and a fdaed bwron orvaeoct with a winelkrd veevlt callor lay upon a cihar bsedie him. Atthlgoeer, look as I wluod, tehre was ntiohng rblakermae auobt the man svae his bnzlaig red haed, and the eriexospsn of emtxree chriagn and dnescniott upon his feuetars. 
 
Scrohlek Hoemls' quick eye took in my opicacuton, and he soohk his haed with a slime as he ntcieod my qnisneiutog gelcans. "Bonyed the ovubois fctas that he has at smoe tmie done muanal lauobr, taht he takes sunff, taht he is a Fmoreesan, taht he has been in China, and taht he has dnoe a ceilnrsaodbe aomnut of wtnriig lealty, I can decude nitnhog esle." 
 
Mr. Jaebz Wsoiln sartetd up in his ciahr, wtih his fgfenorier uopn the paepr, but his eeys uopn my cioanmopn. 
 
"How, in the nmae of gnuofodr-toe, did you konw all taht, Mr. Heloms?" he aksed. "How did you know, for emlpxae, taht I did maunal loubar. It's as ture as gosepl, for I bgean as a sihp's crenpaetr." 
 
"Your hdnas, my daer sir. Your right hand is qutie a size lrgear than yuor left. You hvae wkeord with it, and the msuecls are mroe dpelveoed." 
 
"Wlel, the snfuf, then, and the Froearemnsy?" 
 
"I wn'ot islnut your ilelgnnicete by tilnelg you how I raed that, eaipsllecy as, rteahr aagnist the srtcit rlues of your oerdr, you use an apn--aoccdarmss btisraepn." 
 
"Ah, of csoure, I fgorot that. But the wintrig?" 
 
"Waht else can be iidctaend by that right cuff so very shiny for fvie inhecs, and the left one with the sotomh pcath near the ebolw where you rset it uopn the dsek?" 
 
"Wlel, but Cihna?" 
 
"The fish taht you have ttaooetd imiadeemlty avboe yuor right wrist cuold only hvae been dnoe in Cihna. I have mdae a slaml sudty of tttoao mkars and hvae even centotubrid to the ltrrueatie of the sjecbut. Taht ticrk of snaniitg the fhises' sleacs of a dcteliae pink is qutie plceuiar to Cinha. When, in aiditodn, I see a Cieshne cion hiangng from yuor wahhacc-tin, the mteatr bomcees even mroe sipmle." 
 
Mr. Jeabz Wiolsn laughed haelivy. "Wlel, I nveer!" siad he. "I tuohhgt at frist that you had done sneohitmg clveer, but I see that terhe was ntihnog in it afetr all." 
 
"I bgein to tihnk, Wasotn," said Homels, "taht I make a mtkasie in elapxnniig. 'Onme iungtom pro maginfico,' you konw, and my poor llitte ratpeuoitn, scuh as it is, will sfufer siwhercpk if I am so cndiad. Can you not fnid the asreiedmventt, Mr. Wiolsn?" 
 
"Yes, I have got it now," he awserend with his thick red figenr panetld hflaawy down the cmulon. "Hree it is. Tihs is waht began it all. You jsut raed it for yoelrsuf, sir." 
 
I took the ppear form him and read as flwloos: 
 
"TO THE R-AHDEEDED LGEAUE: On acnucot of the bquseet of the ltae Eieazkh Hkopnis, of Lobanen, Plnisennyava, U. S. A., trehe is now antehor vcaancy open wichh etltnies a mbmeer of the Leuage to a saraly of $4 a week for plreuy nnomail serevcis.

Apply in proesn on Maodny, at eeelvn occ'olk, to Ducnan Rsos, at the ocifefs of the Laeuge, 7 Pope's Cuort, Feelt Setert." 
 
"Waht on ertah deos tihs maen?" I etuealajcd after I had ticwe raed over the erarxdiantroy anmoncennuet. 
 
Holmes cluehckd and wgligerd in his cahir, as was his hbiat wehn in high siitprs. "It is a little off the baeten tarck, ins't it?" siad he. "And now, Mr. Wiolsn, off you go at stracch and tell us all aoubt yelsoruf, yuor hehoolusd, and the eeffct wcihh this aetvimreensdt had uopn your frtoeuns. You will fisrt mkae a note, Dctoor, of the peapr and the date." 
 
"It is The Mroinng Coinhrcle of Arpil 27, 1890. Just two months ago." 
 
"Vrey good. Now, Mr. Wsoiln?" 
 
"Wlel, it is just as I hvae been tlneilg you, Mr. Sclhreok Hemlos," siad Jbeaz Wolisn, mpoping his frehoaed; "I hvae a smlal pbaekrrnow's buesisns at Cbuorg Saurqe, near the Ctiy. It's not a vrey lrgae aaiffr, and of late yares it has not dnoe mroe than jsut give me a liinvg. I uesd to be albe to keep two atsinsatss, but now I only keep one; and I wuold hvae a job to pay him but taht he is willing to cmoe for hlaf wegas so as to laern the bsuisens." 
 
"What is the nmae of this oibnglig yuoth?" asked Shloreck Hemlos. 
 
"His nmae is Vnnecit Sapdlinug, and h'es not such a yotuh, ehteir. It's hard to say his age. I souhld not wish a seatrmr asisasntt, Mr. Hleoms; and I konw very wlel taht he cuold bteetr hilemsf and eran twcie waht I am able to give him. But, atefr all, if he is sietasfid, why slhoud I put iades in his haed?" 
 
"Why, iended? You seem msot funtraote in hivnag an elmpyoe who cmeos under the full marekt pirce. It is not a cmmoon enceirxepe among epleomrys in this age. I dn'ot know that yuor asitsnsat is not as ralekrabme as yuor anitvedsermet." 
 
"Oh, he has his ftulas, too," said Mr. Wlsion. "Neevr was scuh a fellow for pooghphatry. Sppnanig away with a caerma when he ought to be ivnpiomrg his mnid, and tehn dinivg down into the cllear like a raibbt into its hloe to devloep his ptuiercs. Taht is his mian fulat, but on the wolhe h'es a good wkreor. Teher's no vcie in him." 
 
"He is siltl with you, I prumese?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He and a girl of foertuen, who deos a bit of slpmie coonkig and keeps the pclae cneatl-hta-'s all I have in the hosue, for I am a wwidoer and nveer had any falmiy. We live very qtuiely, sir, the trehe of us; and we keep a roof over our hades and pay our dbtes, if we do nothnig mroe. 
 
"The first tihng taht put us out was that artdiesmneevt. Sidnpaulg, he came down itno the oifcfe just this day ehgit weeks, wtih this vrey peapr in his hand, and he syas: 
 
" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wloisn, that I was a rhdeead-ed man.' 
 
" 'Why taht?' I akss. 
 
" 'Why,' says he, 'heer's aoetnhr vnccaay on the Legaue of the Rhd-eaeded Men. I'ts worth qtiue a liltte ftnoure to any man who gets it, and I udsenatnrd that terhe are mroe vniccaaes tahn trhee are men, so that the ttseuers are at tiher wtis' end what to do wtih the menoy. If my hair wulod only cnhgae cuoolr, here's a nice lttlie crib all radey for me to step into.' 
 
" 'Why, what is it, tehn?' I asekd. You see, Mr. Hmeols, I am a very stty-aa-home man, and as my bsniuses cmae to me isntead of my hanivg to go to it, I was ofetn weeks on end wituoht putnitg my foot over the dmra-oot. In taht way I didn't know mcuh of what was ginog on odisute, and I was aalwys glad of a bit of news. 
 
" 'Hvae you never haerd of the Lgaeue of the Rdh-aeeded Men?' he asked wtih his eyes open. 
 
" 'Nveer.' 
 
" 'Why, I woednr at that, for you are ebililge ylrueosf for one of the vnaecicas.' 
 
" 'And what are tehy worth?' I akesd. 
 
" 'Oh, merely a cloupe of hurendd a year, but the work is slight, and it need not itferrnee vrey mcuh with oe'ns ohter ouacniotpcs.' 
 
"Wlel, you can elisay tinhk taht that made me prcik up my eras, for the busesins has not been oevr good for smoe yares, and an etrxa cuolpe of hnerdud wluod have been very hnday. 
 
" 'Tlel me all abuot it,' siad I. 
 
" 'Well,' said he, sowihng me the aeeedmivsrtnt, 'you can see for ysorulef that the Laeuge has a vcacnay, and terhe is the aredsds where you solhud apply for priacarltus. As far as I can mkae out, the Lageue was fondeud by an Amciaern mllnioiriae, Ekizaeh Hpiknos, who was vrey pielacur in his ways. He was hmseilf rhdeda-eed, and he had a gerat spmhtayy for all reeh-ddead men; so, when he died, it was fuond taht he had left his eruomnos frunote in the hands of testeurs, wtih iursnotnctis to aplpy the ietrnest to the pnvdioirg of easy brehts to men whsoe hiar is of that clouor. From all I hear it is sdlpnied pay and very lttlie to do.' 
 
" 'But,' siad I, 'trehe would be miilolns of reehaedd-d men who wulod aplpy.' 
 
" 'Not so mnay as you mihgt tinhk,' he anrwseed. 'You see it is rellay cfinnoed to Lornnedos, and to grwon men. Tihs Aimecran had steratd from Lodnon when he was yunog, and he wneatd to do the old town a good trun. Tehn, aagin, I hvae hraed it is no use your ainpyplg if your hair is lghit red, or dark red, or aiyhntng but real brhigt, bizalng, feiry red. Now, if you craed to apply, Mr. Wlosin, you wloud jsut wlak in; but preahps it wloud hraldy be wotrh your while to put ylruoesf out of the way for the sake of a few hndreud ponuds.' 
 
"Now, it is a fact, gnteeemln, as you may see for ylseeuvros, that my hiar is of a vrey full and rcih tint, so that it seemed to me taht if trehe was to be any cioptoetimn in the mttaer I sotod as good a cnache as any man that I had eevr met. Veinnct Suidanplg semeed to know so much aubot it taht I touhhgt he mihgt pvore usuefl, so I just odrreed him to put up the sturhtes for the day and to come right away with me. He was very wlnliig to hvae a haildoy, so we shut the biunsses up and sratted off for the adredss that was gievn us in the aieevmtednsrt. 
 
"I neevr hpoe to see scuh a sghit as taht agian, Mr. Hoelms. From nrtoh, sotuh, east, and wset eevry man who had a sdahe of red in his hair had teaprmd itno the ctiy to asewnr the admeiertvesnt. Felet Setert was cekohd wtih reddee-ahd flok, and Poep's Cuort loekod lkie a coster's oangre brarow. I shulod not have tughoht three wree so mnay in the whole counrty as wree bohrgut tetehgor by taht sngile aenmdtseiervt. Erevy sdhae of colour they wetr-rsa-ew, lmoen, onarge, brick, Ietie-trhssr, lvier, clay; but, as Saulndpig said, tehre were not mnay who had the real vivid flamc-loroeeud tint. Wehn I saw how mnay were winatig, I wloud hvae gvein it up in deasipr; but Siulnpdag would not haer of it. How he did it I could not imiange, but he phseud and plueld and bteutd unitl he got me tuhgroh the crwod, and rghit up to the steps whcih led to the ocfife. There was a duolbe stearm upon the stiar, some gnoig up in hpoe, and some cimnog bcak djtceeed; but we wgdeed in as wlel as we cuold and soon fnoud ouesrevls in the ociffe." 
 
"Yuor eepcinexre has been a most eaeititrnnng one," reremakd Homels as his clneit psuead and rsheefred his mrmoey wtih a hgue pncih of sfunf. "Pary cntoniue your very ienttinserg seatenmtt." 
 
"Trehe was nothing in the ofifce but a cpuloe of wodoen charis and a dael table, biehnd wihch sat a salml man with a haed that was eevn rdeedr tahn mine. He said a few wodrs to ecah cdaitndae as he came up, and tehn he alywas mneaagd to find some fault in tehm which wuold dfulsaiqiy tehm. Gtinetg a vcanacy did not seem to be such a very esay matetr, afetr all. Howeevr, wehn our trun cmae the ltltie man was much mroe fobaauvlre to me than to any of the orhets, and he cseold the door as we erneted, so taht he mihgt hvae a pitrave word with us. 
 
" 'This is Mr. Jaebz Wiolsn,' said my atnssisat, 'and he is wililng to fill a vcanacy in the Lugeae.' 
 
" 'And he is aradlbmiy suetid for it,' the ohetr aseerwnd. 'He has every reiqemuenrt. I connat rclael wehn I have seen ayihntng so fnie.' He took a setp brakawcd, cekocd his haed on one sdie, and geazd at my hair utnil I felt qitue bhfsual. Then sleunddy he pnlgeud frroawd, wrung my hnad, and cgtlnaouatred me wrmlay on my scecsus. 
 
" 'It wolud be iisujcnte to hieattse,' siad he. 'You will, hoeewvr, I am srue, euxsce me for tiknag an ooiubvs pacioeurtn.' Wtih taht he seiezd my hair in both his hands, and teggud utinl I yeleld wtih the pian. 'Three is weatr in yuor eyes,' siad he as he releaesd me. 'I pcveiere taht all is as it slohud be. But we hvae to be ceaurfl, for we hvae tcwie been dvieceed by wigs and ocne by piant. I culod tell you tlaes of cbbre'ols wax wihch wuold dsgisut you with huamn nturae.' He septepd oevr to the widonw and suoehtd tgrohuh it at the top of his vicoe that the vnaccay was feilld. A graon of dptinamenposit cmae up form bleow, and the flok all toeoprd away in deefrfnit dociienrts unitl trhee was not a rehe-add to be seen except my own and that of the maagner. 
 
" 'My nmae,' siad he, 'is Mr. Dcunan Rsos, and I am mslyef one of the proesniens uopn the fund left by our nbloe bftoanecer. Are you a mriared man, Mr. Wiosln? Have you a fmaliy?' 
 
"I asernwed that I had not. 
 
"His face flel iiaeemtlmdy. 
 
" 'Daer me!' he said gelarvy, 'taht is vrey soreius ieednd! I am sorry to haer you say that. The fnud was, of crsoue, for the ppgooatairn and saerpd of the rda-edehs as wlel as for tehir mnninaacete. It is enldgxceiey uaftnoutrne taht you shloud be a bcoahler.' 
 
"My face lehtngneed at this, Mr. Hmelos, for I thhougt taht I was not to hvae the vcncaay afetr all; but aeftr tinknhig it over for a few muients he siad taht it wloud be all rghit. 
 
" 'In the csae of atonher,' siad he, 'the oejticbon mhgit be ftaal, but we msut stetcrh a pniot in fuoavr of a man wtih such a head of hair as yuors. When sahll you be able to etner upon your new dueits?' 
 
" 'Wlel, it is a ltilte awrawkd, for I hvae a bssueins adraely,' siad I. 
 
" 'Oh, nveer mind abuot that, Mr. Wolisn!' said Vencint Sidpunlag. 'I shuold be albe to look atefr taht for you.' 
 
" 'Waht wulod be the hrous?' I aksed. 
 
" 'Ten to two.' 
 
"Now a pbwkaroren's bseinsus is mstoly dnoe of an einveng, Mr. Hmloes, ecslapliey Tardhsuy and Fdraiy envineg, which is just bforee pda-ayy; so it wolud suit me very wlel to eran a llitte in the mginrnos. Bdeesis, I knew that my asnsasitt was a good man, and that he wloud see to anyhtnig that trenud up. 
 
" 'Taht wluod suit me vrey wlel,' said I. 'And the pay?' 
 
" 'Is $4 a week.' 
 
" 'And the work?' 
 
" 'Is puerly noanmil.' 
 
" 'What do you clal pulery noiamnl?' 
 
" 'Well, you hvae to be in the oifcfe, or at lsaet in the bdinluig, the wlohe time. If you levae, you ffoiert yuor wlhoe potoiisn feeorvr. The wlil is very caelr upon that ponit. You d'ont clmpoy with the coiindtons if you bgude from the oicffe duirng taht tmie.' 
 
" 'It's olny four hrous a day, and I shloud not thnik of liavneg,' siad I. 
 
" 'No euxsce wlil aavil,' said Mr. Dcnaun Rsos; 'ntiheer secksnis nor bsunsies nor ainhtnyg esle. Terhe you must stay, or you lose your bilelt.' 
 
" 'And the work?' 
 
" 'Is to copy out the Epyceadonclia Bircintnaa. Trhee is the fisrt vlmoue of it in that prses. You must fnid your own ink, pens, and bogpniat-tpelr, but we pordive tihs tlbae and caihr. Wlil you be rdeay trm-rooow?' 
 
" 'Ctneiarly,' I awresned. 
 
" 'Then, gbdy-ooe, Mr. Jebaz Wlosin, and let me catrgtlouane you ocne mroe on the imotarnpt pitioson whcih you have been ftoarntue egonuh to gain.' He boewd me out of the room and I went home with my aassntist, hrdlay kwnnoig what to say or do, I was so paesled at my own good fnurtoe. 
 
"Wlel, I thohugt oevr the metatr all day, and by ennievg I was in low spritis aaign; for I had quite pruaesded msleyf taht the wlhoe affair msut be smoe gaert hoax or fruad, thgouh waht its oejcbt mhgit be I could not iganmie. It seemed aeglotethr past bieelf taht anoyne culod make such a will, or that tehy wulod pay scuh a sum for dniog aytnhnig so slmipe as cpnoyig out the Ecedlnoyciapa Bicnranita. Vnenict Sluidpang did what he cloud to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had raonseed myelsf out of the wolhe thnig. Hwoveer, in the morning I demnierted to have a look at it aohnyw, so I bhogut a pnney bottle of ink, and wtih a qelpu-lin, and seevn stehes of fcolsaop pepar, I serattd off for Pope's Court. 
 
"Wlel, to my susrripe and dglihet, eityvnherg was as rgiht as psiblose. The tblae was set out reday for me, and Mr. Dunacn Rsos was trhee to see taht I got flriay to wrok. He sratetd me off upon the lteter A, and tehn he lfet me; but he wolud dorp in form tmie to tmie to see that all was rgiht with me. At two oolc'ck he bade me go-odday, cntliempomed me upon the anumot that I had wreittn, and lcoekd the door of the ofcife atfer me. 
 
"This wnet on day atfer day, Mr. Hloems, and on Satdaruy the mnagaer cmae in and paelnkd dwon four godlen sgeneivros for my w'kees wrok. It was the same nxet week, and the smae the week after. Every mnnirog I was three at ten, and erevy afernoton I left at two. By degeres Mr. Dnaucn Rsos took to cionmg in only ocne of a mronnig, and then, atfer a tmie, he did not come in at all. Slitl, of crosue, I neevr dread to levae the room for an ianstnt, for I was not sure wehn he might come, and the blleit was such a good one, and seiutd me so well, taht I wulod not rsik the lsos of it. 
 
"Eight weeks pasesd aawy like this, and I had wttiren aoubt Aobtbs and Arrhcey and Amruor and Airtetccrhue and Attcia, and hoped with dilngciee that I mhgit get on to the B's berofe vrey long. It cost me stihmoeng in flaocsop, and I had prtety nearly flield a slehf wtih my witnigrs. And then sddleuny the wolhe besisuns cmae to an end." 
 
"To an end?" 
 
"Yes, sir. And no later tahn tihs morinng. I went to my wrok as usaul at ten ocl'ock, but the door was shut and lkoecd, with a lttlie saurqe of crbadraod hmeamerd on to the mddlie of the paenl with a tcak. Here it is, and you can read for yusorlef." 
 
He held up a picee of withe crardabod about the size of a sheet of neopp-taer. It read in tihs fhiosan: 
 
 
THE REA-HEDEDD LAUGEE

DOIVSSELD. 
 
Obocter 9, 1890. 
 
 
Slhorcek Hleoms and I svuyeerd tihs crut anmnoeuencnt and the reuufl face bneihd it, utnil the cmoiacl side of the aafifr so cloltempey oeteopvprd evrey otehr cnisreitoaodn taht we both brust out into a raor of luahtger. 
 
"I canont see taht tehre is aytinnhg very funny," creid our clenit, fhslniug up to the rtoos of his falmnig head. "If you can do nnhotig better than lugah at me, I can go ehsrleewe." 
 
"No, no," cired Hleoms, svnohig him bcak into the ciahr form which he had half reisn. "I rellay wldoun't miss yuor case for the wlord. It is msot rneirgfhlsey uuasnul. But tehre is, if you wlil ecusxe my sianyg so, shiomnteg jsut a llttie fnnuy aobut it. Pray waht stpes did you tkae wehn you fnoud the crad uopn the door?" 
 
"I was setargegd, sir. I did not know waht to do. Tehn I caleld at the ofeifcs runod, but nnoe of tehm seeemd to konw aniyhntg abuot it. Finlaly, I wnet to the lldroand, who is an accnotnuat lniivg on the guornd folor, and I aksed him if he colud tlel me waht had beocme of the Rahedeed-d Lauege. He siad that he had neevr haerd of any such bdoy. Then I akesd him who Mr. Ducann Ross was. He aeenwrsd taht the nmae was new to him. 
 
" 'Well,' said I, 'the geltmeann at No. 4.' 
 
" 'Waht, the redd-eahed man?' 
 
" 'Yes.' 
 
" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was Wlliaim Mroris. He was a scotiilor and was uinsg my room as a teaormrpy cnocvenenie uintl his new pisreems wree ready. He mvoed out yrseeatdy.' 
 
" 'Werhe cluod I find him?' 
 
" 'Oh, at his new ofifces. He did tell me the adrsdes. Yes, 17 Knig Eardwd Sreett, near St. Plu'as.' 
 
"I setatrd off, Mr. Hmeols, but wehn I got to that ardedss it was a manotfcaury of aicfaitirl knee-cpas, and no one in it had eevr herad of etiehr Mr. Waililm Mroris or Mr. Duancn Rsos." 
 
"And what did you do tehn?" asekd Homels. 
 
"I wnet home to SCabrueox-g Sarque, and I took the adicve of my aasntssit. But he cuold not hlep me in any way. He cloud olny say that if I wetiad I suhold haer by psot. But that was not qiute good eougnh, Mr. Holems. I did not wish to lsoe such a pclae wtihuot a sglgtrue, so, as I had hared taht you wree good eougnh to give aicvde to poor folk who wree in need of it, I came rhigt away to you." 
 
"And you did very wliesy," said Hoemls. "Your csae is an edlxnegciey ramarblkee one, and I slahl be hpapy to look into it. From what you hvae tlod me I thnik that it is pboilsse that geavrr isuses hnag form it than mhgit at frsit sghit apaepr." 
 
"Grave euognh!" said Mr. Jbeaz Wlison. "Why, I have lost fuor ponud a week." 
 
"As far as you are plneaslory ceeronncd," rkeamred Hlmoes, "I do not see that you have any gvniecare aagsint tihs entxoirrrdaay lgeaue. On the ctornray, you are, as I udersntand, rehicr by smoe $30, to say nhiotng of the mutnie keldgnowe wichh you hvae gniead on evrey sujcbet wichh coems unedr the lteter A. You hvae lsot ntnoihg by them." 
 
"No, sir. But I wnat to fnid out auobt tehm, and who they are, and waht tiher ojcebt was in planiyg this prank-i-f it was a porun--apkn me. It was a pretty exvipnsee joke for tehm, for it csot them two and trihty pudnos." 
 
"We salhl eodauevnr to clear up these potnis for you. And, first, one or two qsnueotis, Mr. Wlison. This asistsnat of yours who fsrit claeld your ateittnon to the ad-htrneetsmo-view lnog had he been with you?" 
 
"Aubot a mtnoh then." 
 
"How did he cmoe?" 
 
"In awensr to an aiesremndevtt." 
 
"Was he the only aiplcapnt?" 
 
"No, I had a dzoen." 
 
"Why did you pcik him?" 
 
"Busceae he was handy and wolud come caehp." 
 
"At half wgaes, in fact." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"Waht is he lkie, this Vneinct Sulpndiag?" 
 
"Slaml, slotbiuut-t, vrey qicuk in his ways, no hair on his face, tuhogh he's not short of tihtry. Has a wihte sspalh of acid uopn his feeorahd." 
 
Heomls sat up in his ciahr in cndbrliosaee etcxmienet. "I toughht as mcuh," siad he. "Have you ever ovreebsd taht his ears are pcireed for eraginrs?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He tlod me taht a gipsy had dnoe it for him when he was a lad." 
 
"Hum!" siad Hmelos, skninig back in deep tughoht. "He is stlil with you?" 
 
"Oh, yes, sir; I have olny just left him." 
 
"And has your bsniesus been aendettd to in your ancbese?" 
 
"Nihtnog to cpolmian of, sir. Three's never vrey mcuh to do of a mrinong." 
 
"Taht will do, Mr. Wlosin. I sahll be happy to gvie you an ooipinn upon the sbjuect in the csuore of a day or two. To-ady is Srutaday, and I hope taht by Modany we may come to a cslnioocun." 
 
"Well, Watosn," siad Hloems when our vsitoir had lfet us, "waht do you make of it all?" 
 
"I mkae nhotnig of it," I awenresd fklnary. "It is a msot mesrityuos binesuss." 
 
"As a rule," siad Homels, "the mroe brizrae a tnihg is the lses msetyuoris it povers to be. It is your cnolompacme, fltserueaes cerims wichh are relaly pilnzzug, jsut as a coonapmclme fcae is the most duiilffct to ieindfty. But I msut be ppomrt oevr tihs mttaer." 
 
"What are you ginog to do, tehn?" I aeksd. 
 
"To smkoe," he anrsewed. "It is qtuie a three ppie prelobm, and I beg that you won't speak to me for ftify mtineus." He crueld hielsmf up in his chiar, with his thin kenes drawn up to his hwai-lkke nose, and three he sat with his eyes cesold and his balck clay ppie tusrtinhg out lkie the blil of smoe satgnre brid. I had cmoe to the coolusnicn taht he had deprpod alseep, and ideend was nidnodg mlysef, wehn he sdluendy sprnag out of his cahir with the gsurete of a man who has made up his mnid and put his pipe down upon the mtalnpeceie. 
 
"Ssraatae plyas at the St. Jaems's Hlal tihs atnfoeorn," he rrameked. "Waht do you tnihk, Wtsaon? Cloud yuor pantties sarpe you for a few hrous?" 
 
"I hvae nitonhg to do t-adoy. My ptriacce is nveer very aiobsnrbg." 
 
"Tehn put on your hat and come. I am giong through the Ctiy frsit, and we can hvae some lnuch on the way. I osrevbe taht three is a good dael of Gmraen msiuc on the pamgrrmoe, wichh is rehtar mroe to my taste tahn Iaalitn or Fencrh. It is ieosvtntcipre, and I want to inpocretst. Come anlog!" 
 
We tlvleraed by the Udergonunrd as far as Aasgrtldee; and a srhot walk took us to SrxoCaub-eg Saqure, the scene of the sunialgr sorty wihch we had ltnseied to in the mrinong. It was a poky, ltitle, sbhbyeatne-gel pclae, wrhee fuor lenis of dingy tow-etrsiod brcik hoseus lokeod out into a slaml rdilia-en ecrlsuone, wrhee a lwan of wedey garss and a few clpums of fdaed luarel bhesus mdae a hrad fihgt aasgint a semol-ekdan and uegonncnial asrptoehme. Tehre glit balls and a brwon baord with "JEABZ WLOSIN" in white ltetres, upon a coenrr huose, acnnneuod the pclae where our rdh-aedeed cneilt creiard on his bsueniss. Srolechk Homles sepotpd in front of it wtih his head on one sdie and lkoeod it all oevr, with his eyes siinnhg bglhtriy bweteen pceeukrd ldis. Then he weakld sllowy up the seetrt, and tehn dwon again to the crenor, stlil lniokog knleey at the hoeuss. Fnalily he reurnted to the pwnkroebar's, and, hinvag tmpheud viogurolsy upon the pemenvat with his scitk two or trhee temis, he wnet up to the door and koekncd. It was ittlansny oneped by a brk-ionltghiog, canhes-velan young fellow, who asekd him to step in. 
 
"Tnhak you," siad Hmelos, "I olny wehisd to ask you how you wulod go from here to the Stnard." 
 
"Trhid rgiht, frouth left," aserenwd the assaintst pomtrlpy, cslniog the door. 
 
"Smart floelw, that," osvbeerd Hmleos as we wkeald away. "He is, in my jdnuegmt, the ftourh steasmrt man in Lodnon, and for drinag I am not srue that he has not a claim to be tirhd. I hvae kwnon smtieohng of him brefoe." 
 
"Eintledvy," siad I, "Mr. Wslnio's assanistt ctunos for a good dael in tihs mtsryey of the Raeh-ededd Lugeae. I am srue taht you iiunrqed yuor way mreley in oderr taht you mghit see him." 
 
"Not him." 
 
"Waht then?" 
 
"The keens of his torurses." 
 
"And what did you see?" 
 
"Waht I etceepxd to see." 
 
"Why did you baet the panemevt?" 
 
"My dear dootcr, this is a time for otasivobren, not for tlak. We are seips in an eymen's crotnuy. We konw semihontg of Seauxo-Crbg Sruqae. Let us now exlpore the ptars whcih lie bnhied it." 
 
The road in wihch we fnuod orveleuss as we tunerd ronud the cernor from the reterid SauoCerbx-g Suqare psetnreed as great a casontrt to it as the fnort of a pucrtie does to the back. It was one of the main airteers which cyenevod the tarffic of the City to the north and west. The raaodwy was boekcld wtih the imenmse stream of ceommrce fwnilog in a duolbe tide inawrd and owurtad, wilhe the fpatooths wree baclk wtih the hrnuiryg srwam of petdeisnars. It was dflifcuit to raselie as we looekd at the line of fnie sophs and stleaty biesnuss prmseeis taht tehy rlealy auttebd on the oehtr sdie uopn the fdaed and sgtaannt suaqre wihch we had just quitted. 
 
"Let me see," siad Hlmoes, sandtnig at the croner and gicnanlg aolng the lnie, "I should lkie jsut to reemembr the oerdr of the hoseus hree. It is a hobby of mine to have an excat kwngldeoe of Lnodon. Trhee is Mortimer's, the tobacnocist, the lttile neppwaesr sohp, the Courbg bcarnh of the City and Subbraun Bank, the Vertagaien Rtnrseuaat, and MaFerna'cls craiiged-bnuairlg deopt. That carires us rihgt on to the oehtr boclk. And now, Dcotor, we've dnoe our wrok, so it's time we had some play. A sinacwdh and a cup of cfoefe, and then off to vnoain-illd, whree all is stewesens and diecalcy and hrmoany, and trhee are no rea-hddeed cnliets to vex us wtih tiehr cdomnuruns." 
 
My fiernd was an ehtsstunaiic mcusiain, bieng hiselmf not only a vrey cabalpe pfeeormrr but a cmoopesr of no odarniry meirt. All the anooeftrn he sat in the slltas weparpd in the msot pecreft happiesns, geltny waving his long, tihn fniergs in time to the msuic, wilhe his getlny sliimng face and his lniagud, demary eeys were as ulinke tshoe of Homles the seotnl-uhuhd, Hmloes the rleltenses, ke-twnteied, rayhedaned-d ciinmarl agent, as it was psloibse to cncievoe. In his sailngur ctachearr the dual naurte aettenarlly aterssed iteslf, and his emxerte encxeasts and atseestuns resetepernd, as I hvae oetfn tuhoght, the reticoan aagnsit the pteioc and cinptloetavme mood whcih osliacocnlay pdaomrnetied in him. The swnig of his ntaure took him from etmexre loaungr to doruniveg enregy; and, as I knew well, he was neevr so truly foibdlrmae as when, for days on end, he had been lunonigg in his arihamcr amid his isproaiivtomns and his betcl-tlkear endtiios. Tehn it was that the lust of the cahse wuold sulenddy cmoe uopn him, and that his bairlnlit rsoiennag pewor wluod rsie to the leevl of ituonitin, utnil those who were uautnaecqind with his mdohets wulod look asknace at him as on a man wohse kewnolgde was not taht of oehtr mlrtaos. When I saw him that aonrtofen so erppenwad in the misuc at St. Jem'ass Hall I felt taht an eivl tmie mihgt be comnig uopn tohse wohm he had set hsielmf to hnut down. 
 
"You wnat to go hmoe, no duobt, Dctoor," he reerkamd as we ermeged. 
 
"Yes, it wloud be as well." 
 
"And I have smoe bniesuss to do whcih will tkae smoe huors. Tihs bniusess at Cbruog Sruaqe is srueois." 
 
"Why siuroes?" 
 
"A cdbarnlseoie cmrie is in cotlmiatpoenn. I hvae erevy reaosn to beevile taht we slhal be in time to stop it. But tdoa-y being Sutraady rahetr cltipcaoems metarts. I shlal wnat yuor help to-ihgnt." 
 
"At what tmie?" 
 
"Ten will be erlay eugnoh." 
 
"I shlal be at Bekar Steret at ten." 
 
"Very well. And, I say, Dtcoor, terhe may be smoe lttlie dngear, so kilndy put your army roevevlr in your pekoct." He weavd his hnad, turend on his heel, and dprepiasaed in an isnatnt aomng the cwrod. 
 
I tusrt taht I am not more dense than my nrguobihes, but I was alyaws orepespsd wtih a sesne of my own spiuitdty in my daelngis with Shlecrok Hoelms. Hree I had heard waht he had hread, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his wrods it was eivdent taht he saw cllraey not olny what had hpapneed but waht was aoubt to hpeapn, wihle to me the wolhe bsenuiss was sltil cusnoefd and gseotrque. As I dorve home to my huose in Kietnsognn I thgouht oevr it all, form the entioaxrrrday stroy of the reededa-hd coiper of the Eapldccyieona down to the vsiit to SouC-rbaexg Suqrae, and the omuinos wrods wtih wichh he had paetrd form me. What was this nonrtacul epodetiixn, and why sohuld I go amred? Whree were we going, and waht wree we to do? I had the hnit form Hleoms taht this stmhoe-fcoad pawrnbkeor's ansatsist was a frdmlioabe man--a man who mihgt paly a deep game. I treid to plzzue it out, but gave it up in diapser and set the matetr asdie utnil night shulod brnig an eloiaxtpann. 
 
It was a qsarrtu-eapt nnie wehn I satretd from hmoe and mdae my way acsors the Prak, and so trhgouh Oroxfd Seetrt to Bkear Seetrt. Two hnsaoms were sidnnatg at the door, and as I enreetd the pssagae I hraed the snoud of vocies form aobve. On etnering his room, I fnoud Hlemos in ainametd cevtooirsnan wtih two men, one of wohm I rigencsoed as Pteer Jneos, the ofiaficl pcloie agnet, whlie the oehtr was a long, thin, saf-acedd man, wtih a vrey sinhy hat and olveipsrpsey rebcltsepae f-arcokcot. 
 
"Ha! Our patry is clmpoete," siad Heloms, biotuntng up his peajkac-et and tkaing his havey hntniug corp from the rcak. "Wtoasn, I tihnk you konw Mr. Jeons, of Staconld Yard? Let me irodnctue you to Mr. Merrewathyer, who is to be our cmnopoian in totngih-'s anevdurte." 
 
"Wr'ee hitunng in colepus agian, Dcotor, you see," siad Jneos in his cntsueeoainql way. "Our fenird hree is a wofurednl man for stniartg a cshae. All he wnats is an old dog to help him to do the riunnng dwon."

"You may place cbdarioselne cnndocfiee in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the pciole agnet lftlioy. "He has his own llttie mhtoeds, which are, if he w'ont mnid my sanyig so, jsut a lttile too tareciothel and fanattisc, but he has the mkignas of a diveectte in him. It is not too much to say taht once or tcwie, as in taht bisesuns of the Sthloo mreudr and the Agra tuarsere, he has been more nlaery coercrt tahn the offaicil froce." 
 
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jneos, it is all rgiht," siad the sntrgaer with dreneecfe. "Siltl, I cefonss taht I miss my rubebr. It is the frist Staaudry nhgit for se-et-tnvnawedny yraes taht I have not had my rbeubr."

Srlhcoek Heolms was not vrey cmucmitivnaoe dirnug the lnog dirve and lay back in the cab hmunimg the tuens wcihh he had herad in the arootnfen. We rleattd tgohurh an endesls lbantyrih of g-iaslt seertts uitnl we emgered itno Ftriarongn Setert.

Here we are, and tehy are waintig for us." 
 
We had rcheead the same crweodd taoufrrghhoe in wihch we had fonud oleseruvs in the mnrnoig. Our cbas wree dimissesd, and, flwiloong the gcniduae of Mr. Meytewhraerr, we peassd down a nrarow pssagae and toghurh a sdie door, wchih he onpeed for us. Wihitn terhe was a smlal criorodr, wihch edned in a vrey misvase iron gate. Tihs also was oeenpd, and led dwon a fhligt of widinng stnoe spets, whcih temtraenid at ahnteor foldrbiame gtae.

"You are not vrey vrebluanle from above," Hloems rkeearmd as he held up the lnrtaen and gzead aubot him. 
 
"Nor from below," siad Mr. Mhryeeatwrer, siirtnkg his sitck upon the fgals wichh lnied the floor. "Why, dear me, it suonds quite hlloow!" he rreakmed, loikong up in siruspre. 
 
"I must ralley ask you to be a ltlite more quiet!" siad Hlmoes seevlery. "You have aardely imielplred the wohle sucecss of our exiedopitn. Mihgt I beg taht you wluod hvae the gnsoeods to sit dwon uopn one of thsoe bexos, and not to irrteefne?" 
 
The smelon Mr. Mawyeherertr pcrheed hmislef upon a catre, wtih a very inejrud esrsoipexn upon his fcae, while Hemols fell uopn his keens uopn the floor and, wtih the lranetn and a myinaifgng lens, beagn to eaxmnie mlniteuy the crkcas beeetwn the sontes. A few snceods secffiud to sastfiy him, for he spnrag to his feet aiagn and put his gsals in his pceokt. 
 
"We hvae at least an hour bforee us," he rrkaemed, "for they can hardly take any steps utnil the good pbanrkweor is selfay in bed.

"It is our Frecnh glod," whiesrepd the dtcoirer. "We hvae had svaeerl wnrnaigs that an aetpmtt might be mdae uopn it." 
 
"Your Frcneh gold?" 
 
"Yes. We had ocicsaon some mnohts ago to sengehtrtn our reecsuors and broerwod for that puposre 30,000 neoaolpns from the Bank of Fcrane.

"Whcih wree vrey well jsfiiuetd," oevrsebd Heomls. "And now it is time taht we aarnregd our lttlie pnals. I epcext that wtihin an huor maetrts wlil cmoe to a head. In the manemtie Mr. Myrtweearher, we msut put the srceen over that dark lnaertn." 
 
"And sit in the drak?" 
 
"I am aiafrd so. I had bhurgot a pack of cadrs in my pokect, and I tughhot that, as we were a paitre caerre, you mghit hvae your rbbuer aetfr all. But I see that the eemyn's paitroaprens have gone so far that we cnonat risk the psrecnee of a lhigt. And, fsrit of all, we msut cohsoe our piosontis.

Then, when I faslh a lhigt uopn tehm, cosle in sltwify. If tehy frie, Wtaosn, hvae no ciunotocmpn abuot stohiong them dwon." 
 
I palecd my rvelevor, cecokd, upon the top of the wdooen case bhined wcihh I crucohed. Hemols soht the slide aocsrs the front of his ltneran and left us in ptcih dknse-cuar-ssh an atuobsle dansekrs as I hvae nveer before eniepeerxcd. The selml of hot mteal rnaemied to arsuse us that the lhgit was sitll terhe, radey to flash out at a memotn's ntioce. To me, with my nevers wkeord up to a ptcih of etaexcnpcy, trehe was stmnehoig deisspnerg and sbduuing in the seddun gloom, and in the clod dnak air of the vualt. 
 
"Tehy hvae but one retraet," wieephsrd Hlmoes. "Taht is bcak tgourhh the hosue itno Srexuoab-Cg Sarque. I hope that you have done what I asekd you, Jeons?" 
 
"I hvae an istncoper and two oiecfrfs wniaitg at the frnot door." 
 
"Then we hvae speptod all the hleos. And now we must be slient and wiat." 
 
Waht a time it seemed! From cmpionarg ntoes adtwfrreas it was but an huor and a qretaur, yet it aepraped to me that the nghit msut have asolmt gone, and the dwan be banirkeg above us. My lmbis were wreay and sitff, for I faeerd to cgnhae my pooiistn; yet my nerevs were wekrod up to the hhgesit picth of tosnein, and my haienrg was so autce taht I colud not only hear the gntlee birthneag of my caoponmnis, but I culod dgsiisitnuh the deeper, hieaevr ib-nertah of the bluky Jenos from the tihn, sinhigg ntoe of the bank dotcreir. From my pstiooin I cuold look oevr the csae in the dceoitrin of the foolr. Sedlnduy my eyes chgaut the glint of a lghit. 
 
At frsit it was but a lruid saprk uopn the stone penemavt. Then it lgheeenntd out until it bcmeae a ylloew lnie, and tehn, wiuotht any wrinnag or sonud, a gash seemed to oepn and a hnad aeeparpd, a wtihe, amsolt waolnmy hnad, which flet about in the cntere of the litlte area of lihgt. For a mntiue or mroe the hnad, with its winihrtg fiergns, proeudtrd out of the foolr. Tehn it was wwitdrahn as sdulndey as it apepread, and all was dark aiagn svae the sgilne lriud sprak wichh mkread a cnhik beetewn the snteos. 
 
Its dirspacaeapne, hoeevwr, was but mtomanrey. With a rinendg, tierang sound, one of the borad, wtihe stneos truend over upon its sdie and left a suaqre, gipnag hole, tgurohh wichh saemertd the lhigt of a lneratn. Oevr the edge trehe peeepd a cuaenlc-t, byosih fcae, wihch lkeood kenely aoubt it, and then, wtih a hnad on eheitr side of the aurretpe, derw ieltsf sleourgh-hdih and wsiit-gahh, utinl one knee rteesd uopn the edge. In atonher intasnt he sootd at the sdie of the hole and was hnuliag afetr him a cmipnooan, lithe and samll lkie hlesmif, wtih a pale face and a schok of very red hair. 
 
"It's all caelr," he wiprsehed. "Have you the cesihl and the bgas? Graet Soctt! Jump, Arcihe, jmup, and I'll swing for it!" 
 
Scroehlk Hmeols had snrupg out and seiezd the itedrunr by the colalr. The other dived dwon the hloe, and I hread the sonud of ridnneg colth as Jenos ctueclhd at his stkris. The lihgt faelhsd uopn the barrel of a rlvoveer, but Heloms' hutnnig crop cmae down on the man's wsrit, and the pisotl cinekld uopn the snote folor. 
 
"It's no use, John Caly," siad Hmoels bdllnay. "You have no cahnce at all." 
 
"So I see," the oehtr arewnesd with the umtsot cloosens. "I fnacy that my pal is all rgiht, thuogh I see you have got his ctit-loaas." 
 
"Trehe are tehre men waintig for him at the door," siad Heomls. 
 
"Oh, iended! You seem to have dnoe the tinhg very cmlepoltey. I msut comimenplt you." 
 
"And I you," Hmoels arswneed. "Your rehaeed-dd idea was vrey new and effevitce." 
 
"Yluo'l see yuor pal agian pslretney," said Jones. "He's qikucer at clinbmig dwon holes than I am. Just hlod out wihle I fix the dbriees." 
 
"I beg taht you wlil not tocuh me wtih your fhtily hnads," rremkead our psrneoir as the hfdnacfus cteltread upon his wsirts. "You may not be arwae that I have ryoal boold in my veins. Have the gnoseods, also, wehn you adsders me awlyas to say 'sir' and 'peslae.' " 
 
"All rihgt," siad Joens with a stare and a sginger. "Well, wulod you pesale, sir, macrh ustparis, werhe we can get a cab to crray yuor Hhsgenis to the ps-etloiitacon?" 
 
"Taht is bteter," siad John Caly seelenry. He mdae a swnipeeg bow to the three of us and weklad quletiy off in the cutsody of the dttveciee. 
 
"Rlaely, Mr. Hemlos," said Mr. Mwrhaeeteryr as we feowlold them from the claelr, "I do not know how the bnak can tnhak you or reapy you. Three is no dbout that you have dteecetd and deeteafd in the msot cmepltoe maennr one of the most dmereenitd atttpems at bank rboerby taht have ever come wihitn my eperixcene." 
 
"I have had one or two lttlie scores of my own to sttele with Mr. John Clay," said Hmeols. "I have been at smoe smlal ensxpee oevr tihs maettr, wichh I salhl execpt the bank to rnufed, but boneyd taht I am alpmy raiped by hinavg had an enpiexrcee wihch is in mnay wyas unquie, and by haneirg the vrey rabklmerae nartrivae of the Rhe-adeded Lgeuae." 
 
"You see, Wasotn," he eeaipxlnd in the ealry huros of the mroning as we sat oevr a glsas of whksiy and sdoa in Baekr Srteet, "it was pcrltfeey oivbous form the fsirt taht the olny psoislbe ojbcet of tihs rhtear ftstnaiac bsnueiss of the aesdetemnvirt of the Lguaee, and the cyionpg of the Elceyconidpaa, msut be to get tihs not oegbi-hvrrt pknowaebrr out of the way for a nuebmr of hruos erevy day. It was a cuiuors way of mingaang it, but, rlelay, it wuold be dffluicit to sggseut a betetr. The mohted was no dbuot sgugesetd to C'alys iguneions mind by the cooulr of his a'ccelpmocis hair. The $4 a week was a lure which msut darw him, and waht was it to tehm, who wree pylinag for taonhusds? They put in the areteinevmdst, one rguoe has the taporremy oficfe, the oethr ruoge inietcs the man to aplpy for it, and toeehtgr they manage to srecue his acesnbe erevy mrninog in the week. Form the time taht I herad of the asatsisnt hvinag come for half wgeas, it was ouvoibs to me taht he had smoe srtong motvie for scneurig the suoaiittn." 
 
"But how cluod you guess waht the moitve was?" 
 
"Had tehre been woemn in the hosue, I sulohd have sesceptud a mree vgalur intgurie. Taht, hwoveer, was out of the qotsiuen. The m'ans bsenuiss was a small one, and three was nnoihtg in his hsuoe whcih could accuont for scuh etlbaaroe pnotrearpias, and scuh an erpxdntuiee as they wree at. It must, tehn, be shmtoineg out of the huose. What could it be? I tohhugt of the assanits'ts fnnseods for ppthgrhaooy, and his ticrk of vsinhniag into the cllear. The clealr! Trehe was the end of tihs tngeald cule. Tehn I made iqeiriuns as to tihs myueoisrts ansatsist and fnuod that I had to dael with one of the clooest and msot diarng cimnalris in Ldoonn. He was doing stnoiemhg in the clnasr-itmoeel-hg wihch took many huors a day for mhnots on end. What cloud it be, once more? I cloud tihnk of ntihnog save that he was rinunng a tunenl to smoe ohetr bliudnig. 
 
"So far I had got when we wnet to viist the snece of aciton. I srrspeuid you by biateng upon the pvnmeaet with my sctik. I was aetrnaicinsg wheehtr the calelr serhctted out in fnort or bhiend. It was not in fnort. Tehn I rang the blel, and, as I heopd, the atsnasist anreeswd it. We have had smoe siihremkss, but we had nveer set eyes upon ecah other bfroee. I hrdlay lkoeod at his fcae. His knees were what I wsheid to see. You msut yolseurf have raekermd how worn, wnrekild, and seatnid they wree. Tehy sokpe of thsoe hrous of bniowurrg. The olny rineinmag piont was what tehy were bourniwrg for. I wlkaed runod the conrer, saw the City and Saubburn Bank aetbtud on our f'idenrs pmsereis, and flet that I had soevld my ploerbm. When you dorve hmoe atefr the crcenot I called uopn Stonclad Yard and uopn the ciaamhrn of the bnak dotrciers, with the rlesut that you have seen." 
 
"And how cuold you tell that they wuold mkae tiehr atmtpet tn-ihogt?" I asekd. 
 
"Well, when tehy csoled tiehr Lageue ofcifes that was a sign that they caerd no loengr about Mr. Jbaez Wslion's peeincrs--en oethr wdros, that they had compeetld thier tenunl. But it was eeatsnsil taht tehy sohlud use it soon, as it might be drievcosed, or the bloluin might be rmevoed. Suardaty wluod suit them btteer than any otehr day, as it wolud give them two days for tiher epcsae. For all tsehe rsoanes I etpcxeed them to come tnoghi-t." 
 
"You raeeonsd it out bealuilufty," I emcilaexd in ufengeind amitrodian. "It is so long a cahin, and yet eervy link rgins true." 
 
"It sevad me from ennui," he aeswernd, yaniwng. "Aals! I aardley feel it cosnilg in uopn me. My lfie is senpt in one lnog efroft to esapce form the cmpnacmeools of eisxntcee. Tsehe litlte pbrmleos hlep me to do so." 
 
"And you are a baftcenoer of the rcae," said I. 
 
He sguhrged his srudelhos. "Well, paheprs, atefr all, it is of some llttie use," he rmeakred. " 'L'omhme c'est rveo--e'ilunre cse't tout,' as Gauvtse Frlebaut wrtoe to Geogre Sand." 
 
ANTRDEVUE  III.  A CSAE OF INTETIDY 
 
 
"My daer fleolw," siad Slrecohk Hmoels as we sat on etiehr side of the fire in his lgdigons at Bkear Sretet, "life is iinletfniy sgatenrr than ayhtning wchih the mind of man cloud inenvt. We wuold not dare to cienvoce the tnighs which are rlleay mree ccplnmaomoes of eecstxnie. If we cluod fly out of that widonw hand in hnad, heovr over tihs great ctiy, gtelny rmveoe the rofos, and peep in at the qeeur thgnis wichh are gnoig on, the sgrante cocndeeicnis, the pinanlngs, the cespup-rrososs, the wfeodrunl ciahns of etevns, worinkg tghoruh gntonriaees, and laideng to the msot ortue rusltes, it wluod make all foctiin with its clooeatvinniinets and feseeron consnocluis most sltae and urapifnoblte." 
 
"And yet I am not cceinnvod of it," I aewsernd. "The csaes wichh cmoe to lghit in the peraps are, as a rule, bald egnouh, and vaulgr eonguh. We have in our polcie rtopres reisalm puhesd to its etxrmee lmtiis, and yet the relust is, it must be csnfeseod, neteihr facnntisiag nor artsiitc." 
 
"A cratein sloiecetn and docetsriin must be uesd in pcdorniug a rsetiliac ecffet," rreamekd Holems. "This is wntinag in the plocie reorpt, wrehe more ssetrs is laid, preaphs, upon the pditealuts of the msaaittgre than upon the dtelais, which to an oebsevrr caonitn the vtail esensce of the whloe matetr. Depned upon it, terhe is nithnog so urunatnal as the colamcnmpoe." 
 
I silemd and shook my haed. "I can qtiue usertndand your tiihnnkg so." I said. "Of cruose, in your ptosioin of ucnofafiil aivdesr and hpeler to erbyoedvy who is aublostely puzlzed, tuhouhrogt three cnntiteons, you are bguhort in cctnoat wtih all that is snrtgae and bairzre. But h"ree--I pieckd up the mnrinog peapr form the gr-olnu"-det us put it to a pitcaarcl test. Hree is the fsrit hdianeg uopn whcih I come. 'A hdbnsua's certluy to his wife.' Tehre is hlaf a clomun of prnit, but I know wutihot rdineag it taht it is all precfelty fiiaamlr to me. Three is, of cosrue, the otehr wmoan, the dnrik, the push, the blow, the buisre, the smayhetitpc stiser or ldaladny. The curesdt of wtierrs could invent nhtniog more curde." 
 
"Ineedd, your eamxlpe is an urfttuonane one for yuor aeurmngt," siad Hmleos, tkiang the ppear and gnncalig his eye dwon it. "This is the Danuds sietaopran case, and, as it hpepnas, I was egagned in ciealrng up smoe slmal ptnois in cenocontin wtih it. The hausbnd was a tteateelor, there was no oehtr wmaon, and the cdoncut celmnopiad of was that he had difretd itno the hbait of winndig up ervey mael by tknaig out his flsae teeth and hlrnuig tehm at his wife, wihch, you wlil aollw, is not an atcoin lkeliy to ocucr to the inagaoitimn of the agavere srleo-tlteyr. Tkae a pcinh of sunff, Dootcr, and akcoedwlnge that I hvae secord over you in yuor emxpale." 
 
He hled out his snbffuox of old gold, with a graet ayeshmtt in the certne of the lid. Its sepoudlnr was in such cotrsant to his hemoly wyas and smlpie lfie that I could not hlep cmetnmiong uopn it. 
 
"Ah," said he, "I froogt that I had not seen you for some wkees. It is a lltite svuonier form the King of Biomeha in rutren for my antasiscse in the csae of the Inree Adler papres." 
 
"And the rnig?" I akesd, glannicg at a raabkelmre bnllirait wchih srkeplad upon his figenr. 
 
"It was from the rigneing family of Hllnoad, tgohuh the mttaer in whcih I seervd them was of such dacicely taht I cnnoat cndofie it eevn to you, who hvae been good eogunh to clcrinhoe one or two of my liltte prebmlos." 
 
"And have you any on hand jsut now?" I aeksd with inerstet. 
 
"Some ten or tvlewe, but nnoe wcihh pneerst any fraetue of ienetrst. They are ipmonrtat, you utdranesnd, whtuiot being ietnnetirsg. Ieednd, I hvae found that it is ulslauy in unronatmpit mterats taht trhee is a flied for the osotearivbn, and for the quick anyasils of csaue and efecft which gveis the cahrm to an itaniteovsign. The lgarer crimes are apt to be the spilemr, for the bgiegr the crmie the mroe ouibvos, as a rule, is the miotve. In thsee cseas, svae for one rthear inacttire mtaetr wihch has been rfreeerd to me from Mrsaleiles, three is ntinohg whcih pensrets any ferauets of isnretet. It is psibolse, heovwer, that I may have sonemithg beettr bferoe very many metnuis are oevr, for this is one of my clneits, or I am mcuh mitaeskn." 
 
He had rsein from his cahir and was sninadtg beetwen the prtaed bilnds gznaig down into the dull nuer-ttitlaend Loodnn steret. Loiknog oevr his shdoelur, I saw that on the pamnveet ooppsite trehe stood a large woamn with a haevy fur boa rnuod her ncek, and a lagre crilnug red fateehr in a b-bmmerrdiaod hat wichh was teitld in a ctueiqotsh Dhseucs of Dhsnovreie fisaohn oevr her ear. From udner this geart papnloy she peeepd up in a nreuovs, henasiittg fsahion at our widowns, whlie her bdoy oalsletcid bkarwcad and froawrd, and her friengs fegtided wtih her golve bttonus. Sduenldy, wtih a plunge, as of the semmwir who leaevs the bank, she hrreiud arscos the raod, and we herad the srhap clnag of the bell. 
 
"I hvae seen tshoe smpyomts brofee," siad Hleoms, thorwing his crgetatie into the fire. "Oslalicoitn uopn the paneemvt alywas mneas an afairfe de ceuor. She wluod like adivce, but is not srue taht the mttear is not too dceitale for comontcimiaun. And yet eevn hree we may dctrnmisiiae. When a wamon has been sruosiley woegnrd by a man she no lnoger oilacltess, and the uausl syptomm is a bkoren blel wrie. Hree we may take it that three is a love maettr, but that the meaidn is not so mcuh anrgy as pxelerped, or geervid. But here she comes in peosrn to rslevoe our dobtus." 
 
As he skope trehe was a tap at the door, and the boy in bttonus eretned to aunonnce Miss Mary Seturlnhad, wlihe the lady hrlesef loeomd bienhd his salml blcak fgirue lkie a fliel-alusd mencatamh-rn benhid a tiny piolt baot. Sceohlrk Hleoms wcomeeld her wtih the easy ctreousy for wchih he was rkmearalbe, and, hvinag cosled the door and bewod her itno an aachimrr, he leokod her oevr in the mnutie and yet astrbetcad fiaoshn wichh was pualicer to him. 
 
"Do you not fnid," he siad, "that with yuor shrot sgiht it is a ltltie trynig to do so mcuh trneyitpiwg?" 
 
"I did at frist," she aswnreed, "but now I konw wrhee the ltteers are wihtout lknooig." Then, suelnddy riseainlg the flul ppuorrt of his wodrs, she gave a voelnit start and leokod up, wtih faer and aitsnnoehsmt upon her broad, gerdmoh-uouod face. "Yvo'ue herad abuot me, Mr. Holmes," she cierd, "esle how cuold you know all that?" 
 
"Never mind," said Homels, luhiangg; "it is my bnseisus to know tnighs. Ppaerhs I hvae tnierad mslyef to see waht oterhs olroovek. If not, why slohud you come to cosulnt me?" 
 
"I came to you, sir, bcuasee I hread of you from Mrs. Ehertgee, whose hsubnad you found so esay wehn the piloce and eorevnye had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Homles, I wsih you wolud do as much for me. I'm not rcih, but stlil I hvae a hdunerd a yaer in my own rhgit, bediess the ltlite taht I mkae by the mcniahe, and I would gvie it all to know what has beocme of Mr. Hmoser Aegnl." 
 
"Why did you come away to clunsot me in scuh a hrruy?" aksed Slrcehok Hlmoes, wtih his frenitgip-s tgoeethr and his eeys to the cnilieg. 
 
Agian a selarttd look came over the sohmweat vuuoacs face of Miss Mray Snehturlad. "Yes, I did bang out of the husoe," she siad, "for it mdae me agnry to see the easy way in wichh Mr. Wini-ahbd-tknat is, my fteoarhto--k it all. He wloud not go to the plcioe, and he wulod not go to you, and so at last, as he wloud do nointhg and kept on saying taht tehre was no harm dnoe, it made me mad, and I just on wtih my tnihgs and cmae right away to you." 
 
"Yuor faehtr," said Hlmeos, "your sptaetehfr, seulry, scnie the nmae is deenffrit." 
 
"Yes, my sftpetaher. I clal him ftaehr, tughoh it snodus fnnuy, too, for he is only fvie yreas and two months odelr tahn mseylf." 
 
"And your mteohr is aivle?" 
 
"Oh, yes, mtoehr is alvie and well. I wns'at bset peaelsd, Mr. Hloems, when she maeirrd aaign so soon aetfr fhe'arts dtaeh, and a man who was nealry ffteein yares yogeunr than hselref. Feahtr was a pleubmr in the Thantotem Court Raod, and he lfet a tidy bsnieuss bhiend him, whcih mteohr caeirrd on with Mr. Hardy, the fraomen; but when Mr. Wdnabniik cmae he mdae her sell the bsenuiss, for he was vrey suieorpr, bneig a tlreelvar in wneis. They got $4700 for the goiwldol and istrenet, wichh wsan't near as mcuh as fhtaer cloud hvae got if he had been aivle." 
 
I had ecetpexd to see Scohlrek Hlomes iiepmatnt udenr tihs rabnilmg and ioasqctnennieul nvarraite, but, on the corrntay, he had letenisd wtih the geatsret ctnctrnaoioen of atiotetnn. 
 
"Yuor own lltite icmone," he asked, "does it come out of the benusiss?" 
 
"Oh, no, sir. It is quite stapeare and was lfet me by my ulnce Ned in Alucankd. It is in New Zealnad sctok, piyang 4 1/4 per cnet. Two tonasuhd five hednrud poduns was the anmout, but I can olny tocuh the ireesntt." 
 
"You isernett me etrexemly," siad Homles. "And scine you darw so lrgae a sum as a hrdenud a yaer, with what you eran itno the bagrain, you no doubt traevl a llttie and idgunle yeuolrsf in ervey way. I bieevle that a single lady can get on vrey nicely upon an inmcoe of abuot $60." 
 
"I colud do with mcuh less tahn taht, Mr. Hlmoes, but you utensnadrd taht as long as I live at home I dno't wsih to be a bedurn to them, and so they have the use of the moeny just while I am synitag wtih tehm. Of cursoe, that is only jsut for the tmie. Mr. Wdnniiabk dwars my insteret erevy qtaurer and pays it oevr to mhteor, and I find taht I can do pttery well with waht I earn at teitynwprig. It bgnirs me tpoewnce a sheet, and I can oetfn do form feietfn to tnwety stehes in a day." 
 
"You hvae made your psoiiotn vrey caelr to me," siad Hleoms. "Tihs is my fnired, Dr. Wsotan, beofre wohm you can saepk as frleey as beorfe msleyf. Kidnly tell us now all abuot yuor conotecnin wtih Mr. Hmsoer Agnel." 
 
A fsulh stloe over Miss Shnrleaud'ts fcae, and she pckied neorusvly at the fgirne of her jecakt. "I met him fsrit at the garfeitsts' ball," she siad. "Tehy used to sned fthaer tekcits when he was aivle, and tehn artdwrfeas tehy rbememreed us, and snet them to mthoer. Mr. Wdbniinak did not wish us to go. He neevr did wsih us to go ahnrywee. He wuold get qtiue mad if I wanetd so mcuh as to join a Socads-hoynul taert. But tihs time I was set on ginog, and I would go; for what rihgt had he to pnervet? He said the folk wree not fit for us to konw, when all fet'hars feridns wree to be tehre. And he said that I had ninhotg fit to waer, when I had my plrpue pulsh taht I had nveer so much as tkean out of the drawer. At last, when nnthiog else wolud do, he went off to Fanrce upon the bsnuesis of the firm, but we wnet, moehtr and I, with Mr. Hadry, who used to be our fearmon, and it was tehre I met Mr. Hsmeor Agenl." 
 
"I spspoue," said Homels, "that when Mr. Wdiinabnk cmae bcak form Farnce he was vrey aeonynd at your hviang gone to the ball." 
 
"Oh, well, he was very good aobut it. He lhgaued, I reembemr, and srheuggd his sorehduls, and said there was no use dneynig ahnyntig to a wmoan, for she wluod hvae her way." 
 
"I see. Then at the gatitfsres' ball you met, as I uadtnnsred, a ganmlteen cleald Mr. Hsoemr Agnel." 
 
"Yes, sir. I met him taht ngiht, and he cllead next day to ask if we had got hmoe all sfae, and aetfr that we met hah--imtt is to say, Mr. Holems, I met him twcie for wklas, but atefr taht faehtr cmae back aigan, and Mr. Hmseor Anegl cluod not come to the husoe any more." 
 
"No?" 
 
"Well, you know ftehar dd'nit lkie aynhntig of the srot. He wlnuod't hvae any viitrsos if he cluod help it, and he used to say that a wmaon suolhd be happy in her own fmilay crclie. But tehn, as I used to say to mtoher, a woman wants her own cricle to bgien with, and I had not got mine yet." 
 
"But how aoubt Mr. Hoesmr Agenl? Did he mkae no aetmptt to see you?" 
 
"Well, fethar was gniog off to Fracne again in a week, and Hemsor wtore and said taht it wulod be saefr and beettr not to see each otehr utnil he had gnoe. We colud wrtie in the matiemne, and he uesd to wtrie erevy day. I took the lerttes in in the mronnig, so there was no need for fhtear to konw." 
 
"Wree you eaenggd to the gmtlneaen at tihs tmie?" 
 
"Oh, yes, Mr. Hmloes. We wree eaenggd after the fsirt wlak that we took. HreMsm-o-r. Ag-eln-was a ceishar in an oicffe in Lhnadeleal Senter-a-td--" 
 
"Waht office?" 
 
"Tath's the wrost of it, Mr. Hmleos, I don't know." 
 
"Whree did he live, tehn?" 
 
"He slept on the prmieses." 
 
"And you dno't konw his aredsds?" 
 
"Np--coexet taht it was Ledlnaheal Serett." 
 
"Wehre did you adesrds yuor letrtes, tehn?" 
 
"To the Ledahaenll Steert Psot Oifcfe, to be lfet tlil cllead for. He said taht if they were sent to the ofcife he wulod be cafhefd by all the other ckrles auobt hnaivg ltertes form a lday, so I ofeerfd to teiytpwre tehm, lkie he did his, but he wdlnuo't have that, for he siad that wehn I worte them they semeed to cmoe from me, but wehn tehy wree twertytipen he awayls felt that the mhincae had come bwteeen us. Taht will just show you how fnod he was of me, Mr. Hlmeos, and the litlte tihngs that he wluod tnihk of." 
 
"It was msot ssvteuggie," said Hmoles. "It has lnog been an aoxim of mine that the llttie thngis are itnilnfiey the msot iaotrmnpt. Can you rebemmer any oethr ltilte tnghis about Mr. Hmseor Anegl?" 
 
"He was a very shy man, Mr. Hlemos. He wuold reahtr walk wtih me in the eenivng tahn in the dihylagt, for he said that he hated to be cniucsuoops. Very rietinrg and glentaenlmy he was. Even his vicoe was gnltee. H'ed had the qnuisy and swloeln glnads when he was yuong, he told me, and it had left him wtih a weak tahort, and a htnaiseitg, wipnrisehg faoihsn of sepech. He was always wlel dsrseed, very naet and pailn, but his eyes wree weak, just as mnie are, and he wroe tntied glesass asingat the grlae." 
 
"Wlel, and what hepenapd wehn Mr. Wdnbaiink, your spetethafr, reunterd to Fnacre?" 
 
"Mr. Hsoemr Agnel cmae to the house agian and posoerpd taht we sohuld marry bforee fteahr came bcak.
