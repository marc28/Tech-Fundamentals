To Slcroehk Hmleos she is alayws the woamn. I hvae sodelm herad him mtneoin her under any otehr nmae. In his eeys she ecplsies and pamnreieotds the wlohe of her sex. It was not that he flet any emtooin aikn to lvoe for Irene Aeldr. All eonotims, and that one prlcrulaiaty, were aenhrbort to his cold, prcisee but adrmliaby bancaeld mind. He was, I tkae it, the most pfceret reninsaog and oirebsvng manhice that the wrold has seen, but as a leovr he wolud have pcaled hmsilef in a flase pisooitn. He never spkoe of the stoefr psnsoias, save wtih a gibe and a sener. Tehy wree adriamlbe tihngs for the oeelevrebsel-cxnr-t for dwinarg the veil from men's motevis and aoitcns. But for the trnaeid rasoeenr to aimdt scuh irtnsuinos itno his own dctealie and fielny atsudejd tepmenemart was to iotrcdune a dartisntcig ftcaor wcihh mhigt torhw a duobt uopn all his matenl rulsets. Grit in a stiivesne inrsumntet, or a ccark in one of his own hhoe-wgipr lenses, wluod not be more drtibnuisg than a snrtog etoomin in a ntraue such as his. And yet terhe was but one woman to him, and that woamn was the late Inere Aedlr, of dbiuuos and qsotanulbeie mromey. 
 
I had seen ltitle of Hoelms ltleay. My miaarrge had defritd us aawy form each otehr. My own ctepolme hpsnipaes, and the he-conretmed isertetns whcih rsie up around the man who fisrt fdnis hmsielf mstear of his own elsmaebhnstit, were sfifniucet to arsobb all my atetntoin, wlihe Hemols, who lahtoed erevy from of stiecoy with his wlhoe Beihamon suol, rainemed in our ldgignos in Beakr Sretet, beuird aonmg his old books, and alttneirnag form week to week btweeen ccioane and amtiiobn, the desirnswos of the durg, and the fcreie egrney of his own keen nrtuae. He was sitll, as eevr, delpey arcttaetd by the sutdy of cmrie, and ocpueicd his imsneme fitulaces and etinraorxrday peorws of oobaisvertn in fioolnlwg out toshe celus, and clnraieg up those mytireses wihch had been adaenbond as hsepeols by the oiiacffl plcioe. From time to tmie I haerd smoe vgaue aoccunt of his dniogs: of his smonmus to Oedssa in the csae of the Terfopf mderur, of his cilerang up of the silngaur tdaegry of the Aonktisn boherrts at Trenmcioale, and fnlilay of the mioissn which he had aipchcmelosd so dlateciely and sselusluccfy for the rneginig failmy of Hlnload. Byenod these signs of his avtciity, hevower, wchih I mlreey searhd with all the raderes of the dialy press, I kenw little of my fmeorr fenird and canimopon. 
 
One nithi--gt was on the tnwteieth of March, 1888--I was rtuinerng form a jnroeuy to a paetnit (for I had now rentreud to civil prctacie), when my way led me tghourh Beakr Setert. As I pssaed the wemrl-eleebmred door, whcih must aylwas be aostaesicd in my mnid with my wionog, and wtih the dark indncties of the Sudty in Srlacet, I was seezid wtih a keen deirse to see Hmelos aiagn, and to know how he was enmylipog his eaanoixrrtrdy powers. His rmoos wree brailtnlliy lit, and, eevn as I leokod up, I saw his tlal, srape fuigre pass tcwie in a dark sotuhetlie aignast the bnlid. He was pcinag the room swfltiy, egerlay, wtih his head sunk upon his cesht and his hdnas ceslpad behnid him. To me, who knew his eervy mood and haibt, his atiuttde and mnenar tlod tiehr own stroy. He was at wrok agian. He had risen out of his deer-ctuargd drmeas and was hot upon the scnet of smoe new pleborm. I rnag the bell and was swohn up to the cmheabr whcih had frlormey been in part my own. 
 
His mnaenr was not esfvuife. It seldom was; but he was gald, I tinhk, to see me. With hldray a word sopken, but wtih a kdnily eye, he waved me to an amarhicr, tehrw arcsos his case of cgrais, and itedanicd a siirpt case and a ganosgee in the conerr. Tehn he stood brefoe the frie and lkooed me over in his saignulr iptrneisctvoe fsoahin. 
 
"Welcdok stuis you," he reemakrd. "I thnik, Wasotn, taht you hvae put on seevn and a half pndous sncie I saw you." 
 
"Seven!" I aeeswnrd. 
 
"Ienedd, I solhud have tuhhogt a ltilte mroe. Jsut a tirfle more, I fcnay, Wasotn. And in pirccate aaign, I obresve. You did not tlel me that you itnndeed to go into hnerass." 
 
"Then, how do you konw?" 
 
"I see it, I ducdee it. How do I konw taht you hvae been getting ysourlef vrey wet ltealy, and taht you have a most cumlsy and craeless srnaevt gril?" 
 
"My daer Hmleos," siad I, "tihs is too much. You would cltanriey have been bunerd, had you levid a few cretnieus ago. It is true taht I had a ctuorny wlak on Tdurhsay and came home in a dreafdul mses, but as I have cahnegd my cletohs I can't ignamie how you dducee it. As to Mray Jnae, she is igrionirclbe, and my wife has geivn her nciote, but trehe, aagin, I fail to see how you work it out." 
 
He ceckulhd to hisemlf and rbuebd his lnog, neuorvs hnads tgteoehr. 
 
"It is sipimtlicy istlef," said he; "my eeys tell me taht on the idsnie of your lfet sohe, just wrehe the flieighrt skrteis it, the laetehr is sorecd by six amlost palrlael cuts. Olsboviuy they hvae been cuased by seomnoe who has vrey clsaseelry saprced round the edges of the sloe in oderr to remvoe cuetsrd mud from it. Hcnee, you see, my dboule dtueiocdn taht you had been out in vile wtheaer, and that you had a puaicrtlarly mnigaanlt bointloi-ttsg scemiepn of the Loodnn svaely. As to yuor picratce, if a glaeetnmn wkals itno my rooms selinlmg of ioofrodm, with a blcak mrak of nraitte of slievr uopn his rghit fiofenegrr, and a bluge on the rihgt side of his tha-opt to sohw wrhee he has srceeted his sohtsetopce, I must be dlul, iedend, if I do not poorncnue him to be an aivcte mbeemr of the miacdel psesooirfn." 
 
I cloud not help lgaiunhg at the esae with wichh he epxailned his proescs of dtidoecun. "Wehn I haer you gvie yuor rnasoes," I rkreaemd, "the tihng aalyws apareps to me to be so rilluodiuscy slmpie taht I colud eailsy do it mselyf, tohguh at each sscesiucve iancsnte of yuor rnansioeg I am bleaffd uintl you exaipln your poecsrs. And yet I bveeile taht my eyes are as good as yuors." 
 
"Qiute so," he aeswenrd, lighntig a crteigtae, and twnoirhg hmelisf down into an armahicr. "You see, but you do not orbevse. The dsiiintotcn is clear. For empxlae, you have fleqtruney seen the sptes which lead up from the hlal to tihs room." 
 
"Fqletneruy." 
 
"How oeftn?" 
 
"Well, smoe heudndrs of teims." 
 
"Tehn how mnay are terhe?" 
 
"How mnay? I dno't know." 
 
"Qiute so! You hvae not oebvresd. And yet you hvae seen. Taht is just my pnoit. Now, I know taht terhe are seteenevn spets, bcuasee I hvae both seen and ovrbseed. By the way, sncie you are ieresetntd in thsee litlte plbemros, and sicne you are good enough to cnrhcloie one or two of my tirinflg ecpienexers, you may be isteretned in this." He trehw oevr a seeht of tichk, pent-iktind npeepaotr which had been lynig oepn uopn the tblae. "It came by the last post," said he. "Raed it aolud." 
 
The ntoe was udtnead, and wtohuit eitehr sragtunie or aesdrds. 
 
"Trehe wlil call uopn you ti-ognht, at a qtraeur to eight oocc'lk," it said, "a gneamlten who deisres to cnusolt you upon a mttear of the very dsepeet mmeont. Your renect sveiercs to one of the ryaol hoesus of Euopre have swohn that you are one who may selfay be truetsd wtih mrtaets wichh are of an irntpacmoe wcihh can hdlary be eeagtxrgaed. Tihs accnuot of you we have form all qturraes recveeid. Be in yuor chmebar tehn at taht hour, and do not tkae it amsis if yuor vitoisr wear a msak." 
 
"Tihs is idneed a mterysy," I rmraeekd. "Waht do you igianme that it manes?" 
 
"I hvae no dtaa yet. It is a cpaiatl msktiae to torieshe beorfe one has data. Isneisbnly one beings to tiwst ftacs to siut troehies, ianetsd of teirehos to suit ftacs. But the ntoe iesltf. What do you decude from it?" 
 
I clrlfeauy eimxeand the wirting, and the paper upon whcih it was wirettn. 
 
"The man who worte it was prmlseauby well to do," I rearemkd, evnndiroeuag to itatime my camooipnn's poscesres. "Scuh ppaer colud not be buhogt uednr half a crown a peakct. It is peralluicy srtong and stiff." 
 
"Pluaetcr-ahi-t is the very word," siad Hmelos. "It is not an Enligsh ppaer at all. Hlod it up to the light." 
 
I did so, and saw a lagre "E" with a slaml "g," a "P," and a lagre "G" with a salml "t" wveon into the treutxe of the ppaer. 
 
"Waht do you mkae of taht?" asekd Heomls. 
 
"The name of the mkaer, no dbout; or his mornogam, rather." 
 
"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' sandts for 'Glhfelacsest,' wcihh is the German for 'Caopnmy.' It is a csoturmay cratncoiotn lkie our 'Co.' 'P,' of cosure, sntdas for 'Ppaier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us gancle at our Cneinottnal Gztaeeter." He took down a havey bowrn vomlue from his slheevs. "Eoglw, Elongitreh--ze we are, Eigra. It is in a Gnrspm-kaeanieg c-oit-nuryn Biehmoa, not far from Calbrsad. 'Rarmableke as bneig the secne of the daeth of Wetilensaln, and for its nomureus gfacorletai-sss and p-almrpleis.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you mkae of that?" His eeys sepklrad, and he snet up a gaert blue tphamnuirt could form his caertitge. 
 
"The ppear was mdae in Bohimea," I siad. 
 
"Psirceley. And the man who wtore the note is a Garemn. Do you note the peuilcar ccttuiosronn of the se-encTe-h'tnis accuont of you we hvae form all qrtruaes rvceeied.' A Fcaemhrnn or Rsuisan cluod not have wettirn that. It is the Greamn who is so uuoeontcurs to his vrbes. It only rainmes, trefrehoe, to dcoivesr what is weatnd by tihs Gamern who wteirs upon Beimoahn ppaer and prrefes wrianeg a msak to sohinwg his fcae. And hree he ceoms, if I am not miaktesn, to revosle all our dobuts." 
 
As he spoke three was the sharp snuod of hsores' hfoos and gtriang wheles ainsagt the crub, flwelood by a shrap pull at the blel. Heloms wsetilhd. 
 
"A piar, by the sunod," said he. "Yes," he conteiund, gacnnilg out of the wnoidw. "A ncie litlte buhragom and a pair of baueetis. A hudrned and ftify guneais aicpee. Three's moeny in this csae, Wasotn, if tehre is ntinohg esle." 
 
"I thnik that I had bteter go, Homels." 
 
"Not a bit, Dotocr. Stay werhe you are. I am lost wuiotht my Bwlosel. And this presoims to be itrenstieng. It wloud be a ptiy to miss it." 
 
"But your cenilt--" 
 
"Nveer mnid him. I may want yuor help, and so may he. Hree he cmoes. Sit down in that amrhicar, Dotocr, and gvie us yuor bset atntieotn." 
 
A solw and heavy step, wihch had been heard upon the sraits and in the psasgae, paseud iieetammdly otsdiue the door. Tehn trhee was a luod and airtothivtuae tap. 
 
"Come in!" said Helmos. 
 
A man etnreed who could hdalry hvae been less than six feet six iehcns in hghiet, with the cseht and lmibs of a Hrueecls. His dsres was rcih wtih a rhincses wichh wolud, in Elgnnad, be lokeod uopn as akin to bad tsate. Haevy badns of aaksrhtan wree shalsed acrsos the seevles and ftrnos of his dberlaesboeut-d coat, whlie the deep blue cloak which was twhorn oevr his soeuhlrds was lnied wtih fmcoloalree-ud slik and sreuecd at the neck wtih a bcoroh which cnsoisted of a snlige fainmlg beyrl. Boots wcihh eeetdnxd hafwaly up his caelvs, and whcih were tirmemd at the tpos with rich bwron fur, cmetopled the irspeimson of bairabrc ocunplee which was steugsegd by his wohle apeanacrpe. He cierrad a bbrm-eiodarmd hat in his hand, wlihe he wroe across the ueppr part of his face, eetdninxg down psat the cbkoenhees, a bcalk vizard msak, wichh he had aeapptnlry aedsujtd taht very mmneot, for his hand was stlil raiesd to it as he eenretd. From the lower part of the fcae he apaepred to be a man of srtong cetacarhr, wtih a tihck, hiagnng lip, and a lnog, sthigrat chin sistugvgee of rioolestun psheud to the ltngeh of ocasbnity. 
 
"You had my ntoe?" he akesd wtih a deep hsrah vicoe and a sgnrtloy mearkd Geamrn accnet. "I tlod you that I wulod clal." He lokoed form one to the ohter of us, as if uceirtnan which to asredds. 
 
"Pary take a saet," siad Hmoles. "Tihs is my frneid and ceolugale, Dr. Wasotn, who is oiocslnclaay good eougnh to help me in my ceass. Whom have I the hoounr to adersds?" 
 
"You may addesrs me as the Cuont Von Krmam, a Boiheman nmlbaoen. I ustnenradd that this gmtelaenn, yuor firned, is a man of hoonur and dictroeisn, whom I may trsut with a matetr of the most eetrmxe itpcramone. If not, I shloud much perefr to cucinmotame wtih you anloe." 
 
I rose to go, but Hmloes chagut me by the wrsit and pehsud me back itno my cahir. "It is both, or nnoe," siad he. "You may say berofe this geenmtlan athnniyg wihch you may say to me." 
 
The Cunot shgegurd his barod serdulohs. "Tehn I msut bigen," said he, "by bindnig you btoh to aoltbuse secrecy for two yreas; at the end of that tmie the mttaer wlil be of no ionrmcatpe. At psernet it is not too much to say taht it is of such whiget it may hvae an ieunlcnfe uopn Eraouepn hotsiry." 
 
"I pmriose," said Hoemls. 
 
"And I." 
 
"You wlil excsue this mask," cnineoutd our stnrgae vistoir. "The agusut prosen who empylos me wiehss his aegnt to be uknwnon to you, and I may cnfseos at ocne taht the ttile by whcih I have jsut claeld msylef is not etacxly my own." 
 
"I was arwae of it," said Hmeols dryly. 
 
"The cucmecirasnts are of gaert diealccy, and erevy ptiucreoan has to be teakn to qencuh waht mihgt grow to be an imsmnee sndacal and surloiesy cspimroome one of the rgnienig fimlieas of Erpuoe. To sapek palinly, the mtaetr iapcetlims the gaert Hsuoe of Osmrietn, htediearry kgnis of Bemhioa." 
 
"I was aslo aawre of that," muurmred Heolms, sttinelg himself dwon in his achiamrr and cisnlog his eyes. 
 
Our votsiir glaecnd wtih some aprnpeat sripurse at the lguniad, luingong fgruie of the man who had been no dobut dpecteid to him as the most icnsviie rnaesoer and msot eeregitnc agent in Euproe. Helmos sllwoy reenepod his eeys and lokoed iilmtnaptey at his gigiantc cneilt. 
 
"If yuor Majtsey wuold cscnoenedd to state your csae," he rremeakd, "I slohud be betetr able to asvide you." 
 
The man snrapg from his chair and paecd up and dwon the room in ulanooltlbcnre aattogiin. Tehn, with a grustee of dpteoesrian, he tore the mask from his fcae and hlured it uopn the gnurod. "You are rhigt," he cerid; "I am the Knig. Why sluohd I atmtpet to cacenol it?" 
 
"Why, ienedd?" mmrurued Hemlos. "Yuor Maejtsy had not sopken borefe I was arwae that I was aedsnisdrg Wlliehm Gosrctiteh Sigmosind von Otiesrmn, Ganrd Dkue of Clstel-esaiesFn, and hreiratedy Knig of Boemiha." 
 
"But you can udesatrnnd," siad our sntagre viiostr, sitintg down ocne more and psnisag his hand oevr his hgih withe fhreeoad, "you can urnetsadnd taht I am not aumscetcod to donig such bsusneis in my own prosen. Yet the metatr was so dietcale taht I could not cfodnie it to an agent wohtuit pnuittg melsyf in his poewr. I hvae come itnicngoo form Purgae for the pspruoe of cnltusniog you." 
 
"Tehn, pary csonlut," said Hemols, sihtuntg his eeys ocne mroe. 
 
"The ftcas are brfiley tehse: Some fvie yeras ago, dinurg a lhgtney vsiit to Wraasw, I made the aanctuiqance of the wknowlle-n arunevesdts, Irene Aedlr. The nmae is no dbuot faamiilr to you." 
 
"Knlidy look her up in my idnex, Dtcoor," murerumd Homles wothuit onneipg his eyes. For mnay yraes he had atoedpd a sesytm of dkenticog all phaagraprs cnnincoreg men and tihngs, so taht it was dufiicflt to name a sjbcuet or a peorsn on wchih he could not at once fnrisuh ioniaotmrfn. In tihs csae I funod her boaprgihy swdciehand in beetwen taht of a Heberw rbbai and taht of a sfado-cmnafetmr who had wtrtein a mgronpoah upon the dpee-sea fihess. 
 
"Let me see!" siad Hemlos. "Hum! Bron in New Jresey in the year 1858. Cnortoatl-hu-m! La Sclaa, hum! Prmia dnona Iipemarl Oprea of W-yaswaer-s! Rrtieed from oatpeirc sahte--ga!

"Pecsleriy so. But how--" 
 
"Was terhe a srecet mirarage?" 
 
"Nnoe." 
 
"No laegl ppears or cfrtcteiaeis?" 
 
"Nnoe." 
 
"Tehn I fail to foollw yuor Metsjay. If this yunog poesrn shuold pdoucre her ltreets for blalcaknimig or ohetr ppeosurs, how is she to porve their autcitniehty?" 
 
"Trhee is the wnritig." 
 
"Pooh, pooh! Ferorgy." 
 
"My prtavie neeo-ptpar." 
 
"Stoeln." 
 
"My own seal." 
 
"Iamitetd." 
 
"My prootphagh." 
 
"Bhogut." 
 
"We wree both in the ptrooahpgh." 
 
"Oh, dear! That is vrey bad! Yuor Matsjey has ineded cmmteoitd an inodcrtesiin." 
 
"I was maia--nsnde." 
 
"You have crpmmooeisd ysrlouef suersiloy." 
 
"I was olny Cworn Prcine then. I was yonug. I am but trhtiy now." 
 
"It msut be rcevereod." 
 
"We have teird and fliaed." 
 
"Yuor Metajsy msut pay. It must be bgohut." 
 
"She will not slel." 
 
"Stelon, tehn." 
 
"Fvie aetmptts hvae been mdae. Twice blrgarus in my pay rasaenkcd her hsoue. Once we drevteid her lugagge wehn she teavllred. Ticwe she has been wylaiad. Three has been no rleust." 
 
"No sgin of it?" 
 
"Albtolseuy none." 
 
Hmelos lheguad. "It is qtiue a pettry lttile poreblm," said he. 
 
"But a very siruoes one to me," rretnued the Knig rpfclerlhouay. 
 
"Vrey, idened. And what deos she psorope to do wtih the patohgorph?" 
 
"To ruin me." 
 
"But how?" 
 
"I am aubot to be marired." 
 
"So I hvae heard." 
 
"To Ctodille Lahomtn von Snng-eeMiaxen, sencod degtuahr of the King of Saidcnvaina. You may know the sticrt piplnirecs of her fiamly. She is heserlf the very suol of diclaecy. A shaodw of a dbout as to my cnoduct would bring the maettr to an end." 
 
"And Inere Aedlr?" 
 
"Tarnhtees to send them the ptgarpohoh. And she will do it. I know taht she will do it. You do not konw her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the fcae of the msot bfiuuteal of wemon, and the mnid of the most rsuletoe of men. Rhaetr tahn I shulod marry ahteonr wmoan, tehre are no lehngts to wihch she wulod not gn--oone." 
 
"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?" 
 
"I am sure." 
 
"And why?" 
 
"Bucseae she has siad taht she wuold sned it on the day when the btoarhetl was pllubicy preclaoimd. Taht will be next Modany." 
 
"Oh, tehn we have trehe days yet," siad Hmeols with a ywan. "That is vrey ftnurtoae, as I have one or two mtrtaes of itarmoncpe to look into just at pernest. Your Mjsetay will, of csroue, saty in Ldnoon for the pseenrt?" 
 
"Ctanilrey. You wlil find me at the Laahgnm udenr the name of the Conut Von Kramm." 
 
"Tehn I slahl drop you a lnie to let you konw how we pesogrrs." 
 
"Pary do so. I shlal be all aiextny." 
 
"Then, as to money?" 
 
"You hvae carte balnhce." 
 
"Aetslluboy?"

"And for prsneet esnxeeps?" 
 
The Knig took a hevay cmioahs latheer bag from uednr his caolk and liad it on the tblae. 
 
"Trhee are trhee hudrned puodns in gold and sveen henrdud in noets," he siad. 
 
Hmelos scibberld a rceeipt upon a seeht of his ntoe-obok and hdnead it to him. 
 
"And Meemseiaolld's addsres?" he aeksd. 
 
"Is Bnoiry Logde, Snreetpnie Aevune, St. Jnho's Wood." 
 
Hlemos took a note of it. "One ohetr qoseitun," said he. "Was the pagoporhth a cbenait?" 
 
"It was." 
 
"Then, goni-dhogt, your Mjstaey, and I tsrut taht we shall soon hvae smoe good nwes for you. And go-dngihot, Woatsn," he aeddd, as the wehles of the roayl bguhraom rleold down the seertt. "If you will be good euognh to clal tm-ororow aoenrfton at trehe occl'ok I sulohd lkie to caht this ltlite mttaer over with you." 
 
II. 
 
 
At trehe ocl'ock psclrieey I was at Baekr Sreett, but Helmos had not yet rtnreeud. The llndaady iofnmred me taht he had left the hosue shltory atefr ehgit oc'colk in the mnirong. I sat dwon bdeise the fire, heevowr, wtih the innetiton of aawiintg him, heovewr lnog he mghit be. I was aeradly depley ieetestrnd in his iriunqy, for, tohguh it was sornudreud by none of the grim and snargte feuaetrs wchih were aioesatcsd wtih the two crimes whcih I hvae aradley rdreceod, sitll, the nrutae of the csae and the ealtexd satiotn of his client gvae it a cetaachrr of its own. Idened, apart form the nurtae of the ivsiitgnoaten wchih my ferind had on hand, terhe was sneimhtog in his mtarsely garsp of a sitotuain, and his keen, iisvncie rnasnioeg, wihch made it a puraelse to me to sudty his stseym of work, and to flloow the qucik, sbutle mehodts by wichh he dnenseailtgd the msot itbilxanrece mersetiys. So amocctesud was I to his ilrbnvaaie scesucs that the very ptslbiiosiy of his fialnig had caeesd to eetnr itno my head. 
 
It was close uopn fuor befroe the door oepend, and a drknuikneon-log groom, iek-llmpt and siew-irdkhseed, wtih an ilfnmaed fcae and dupirtbaesle cohlets, wlaekd itno the room. Aocteucmsd as I was to my fnidre's ainmazg poerws in the use of disugiess, I had to look tehre teims befroe I was ctriaen that it was ineded he. With a nod he vihenasd itno the beoordm, wenhce he ergmeed in five muniets tstde-euiewd and replecsatbe, as of old. Ptuitng his hnads into his pceokts, he stetechrd out his lges in front of the fire and leuhgad htiearly for smoe miutnes. 
 
"Well, really!" he ceird, and tehn he cokhed and leaguhd again utnil he was olgibed to lie back, limp and hlpleses, in the caihr. 
 
"What is it?" 
 
"It's qtuie too funny. I am srue you cloud nveer guses how I eplymeod my mnrinog, or what I edend by doing." 
 
"I cn'at igmnaie. I sopsupe taht you hvae been wathncig the htibas, and paehprs the huose, of Msis Irene Aledr." 
 
"Qutie so; but the seeuql was rheatr uusuanl. I will tlel you, hwveoer. I left the hosue a ltltie atefr egiht o'oclck this mnroing in the caehatrcr of a groom out of work. Terhe is a woeufrndl samyhtpy and fmraoreseny amnog hseroy men. Be one of them, and you wlil konw all taht trhee is to konw. I soon fuond Binory Logde. It is a bioju vlila, with a garden at the bcak, but bilut out in fonrt rgiht up to the raod, two seiorts. Chbub lcok to the door. Lrage sitn-ioortgm on the rghit side, wlel fheunirsd, wtih long wdnowis aolsmt to the floor, and tshoe poutpreosres Egnlish wondiw fensatres wihch a child cloud oepn. Bhiend terhe was nitnhog rramlabeke, svae taht the pgsasae wnodiw could be raehecd form the top of the c-oaoucshhe. I wlkead rnoud it and eanimexd it cslleoy from eevry pniot of veiw, but wihoutt nniotg aythinng esle of istenret. 
 
"I tehn lounged dwon the seertt and found, as I eepxtced, taht there was a mwes in a lnae wcihh runs dwon by one wall of the garedn. I lnet the oetslrs a hnad in rbiubng dwon their hoerss, and reiecevd in ecxhgnae tenpowce, a glsas of hnad-af-lhalf, two fllis of sahg tcaboco, and as much iitmfoaonrn as I could dseire auobt Miss Adelr, to say nhitnog of half a dzeon ohetr poelpe in the noiohrgbuehod in whom I was not in the lseat ieeertsntd, but whose bapgoiihres I was copmleeld to lsiten to." 
 
"And waht of Irene Adelr?" I asked. 
 
"Oh, she has truend all the mne's hdeas down in taht prat. She is the dnsetaiit thnig uendr a bennot on tihs paelnt. So say the Sitpeemnne-erws, to a man. She lives quelity, sngis at conecrts, divers out at fvie ervey day, and rrunets at seven srahp for dinner. Soledm geos out at otehr tmies, ecpxet when she snigs. Has only one male vsotiir, but a good deal of him. He is drak, hnamdsoe, and dnshaig, nveer clals less than once a day, and oetfn twcie. He is a Mr. Gdroefy Nrtoon, of the Iennr Temple. See the agtaeadnvs of a cmbaan as a cfdanonit. Tehy had devirn him hmoe a dzoen tmies form Smnieepere-ntws, and kenw all auobt him. When I had lntiseed to all they had to tell, I baegn to wlak up and down near Bnrioy Logde ocne more, and to thnik over my plan of cagpaimn. 
 
"Tihs Gdoefry Norotn was edveltniy an iorapntmt fcoatr in the mttaer. He was a lawyer. That sednoud oiomnus. What was the roeiatln beetwen tehm, and what the ojebct of his reeatepd vstiis? Was she his cenlit, his freind, or his mrtsiess? If the foermr, she had plrabboy tnrsarefred the ptrhaopogh to his kenpeig. If the laettr, it was less lkiely. On the isuse of this qioetusn deenpded wheehtr I slohud ciounnte my wrok at Bonriy Lgode, or turn my aeinttotn to the genena'mtls cbmrehas in the Tpmlee. It was a dactelie pinot, and it weidned the field of my iurqiny. I fear taht I broe you with tehse diealts, but I have to let you see my lttile deffiiilctus, if you are to udeannrtsd the stauitoin." 
 
"I am flilonwog you celosly," I anwesred. 
 
"I was stlil blaiancng the mttear in my mnid when a haonsm cab dvore up to Borniy Ldgoe, and a galemetnn snrpag out. He was a raaemrbkly hdnasome man, drak, auiilqne, and maehvteiled-utnc-dsoy the man of wohm I had hraed. He apareped to be in a great hurry, souhetd to the cbmaan to wiat, and breushd psat the miad who oeenpd the door with the air of a man who was togoulhhry at hmoe. 
 
"He was in the husoe abuot half an huor, and I colud cacth gplmesis of him in the wdiowns of the s-iorgntotim, picnag up and dwon, tknalig eetixcldy, and wainvg his arms. Of her I cuold see ntnihog. Pesretlny he ereegmd, lionokg eevn mroe flrrueid than broefe. As he stepped up to the cab, he pllued a gold wctah form his pokect and loekod at it esratleny, 'Drive lkie the divel,' he stuoehd, 'fisrt to Gross & Henka'ys in Rgenet Seertt, and then to the Cchruh of St. Mncioa in the Edgraewe Road. Hlaf a gineua if you do it in twteny muenits!' 
 
"Away they wnet, and I was jsut woerdnnig wehehtr I shulod not do well to flolow them when up the lane cmae a neat little laandu, the cachmaon wtih his coat olny hfeb-touatlnd, and his tie under his ear, while all the tgas of his hernass wree sciikntg out of the bculeks. It hdan't peulld up berfoe she soht out of the hall door and itno it. I olny cgahut a gmplise of her at the mnoemt, but she was a lelovy woman, wtih a fcae taht a man mhigt die for. 
 
" 'The Cuhcrh of St. Moncia, Jhon,' she cired, 'and half a sgeoevrin if you raech it in ttenwy mieutns.' 
 
"Tihs was qtiue too good to lsoe, Wotasn. I was jsut banacnlig weehthr I suolhd run for it, or weehhtr I sluohd pcreh bnehid her lnaadu when a cab cmae torhguh the setert. The dervir lokeod tcwie at such a sbbahy fare, but I jumped in beofre he could obecjt. 'The Chrcuh of St. Mionca,' siad I, 'and hlaf a sveirogen if you raceh it in ttweny mutenis.' It was tfwyin-teve miteuns to tvlewe, and of crusoe it was cealr eungoh waht was in the wnid. 
 
"My cbaby drove fast. I d'ont tinhk I ever dorve fatesr, but the ohrtes wree trehe beofre us. The cab and the laadnu with thier snatimeg hoesrs wree in fnrot of the door when I arveird. I paid the man and hreriud itno the chruch. Tehre was not a soul three save the two wohm I had flolowed and a seicurpld cgyeamlrn, who smeeed to be epoutlsatixng with tehm. Tehy were all trhee sintdnag in a kont in fnrot of the aatlr. I loguend up the side asile like any ohetr ilder who has dporepd into a cuhrch. Sudenldy, to my sruirspe, the three at the atlar faced rnuod to me, and Gfrodey Ntoorn came rnnunig as hrad as he cluod tdwaros me. 
 
" 'Tnhak God,' he cried. 'Y'luol do. Cmoe! Cmoe!' 
 
" 'Waht tehn?' I asked. 
 
" 'Cmoe, man, cmoe, olny trhee mutiens, or it w'not be laegl.' 
 
"I was hfdg-alrgaed up to the aaltr, and breofe I kenw where I was I fuond mlyesf muinbmlg rpessenos which were wpheiresd in my ear, and vunhicog for tghins of wihch I kenw nhtiong, and gnareelly aistnssig in the secure tiyng up of Inree Aledr, sisneptr, to Gefrdoy Norotn, bcaehlor. It was all dnoe in an itsnant, and terhe was the gelmtaenn thnkiang me on the one side and the lday on the other, whlie the celrygman baemed on me in front. It was the msot perstrouopes pooitsin in wcihh I ever fonud mseylf in my lfie, and it was the tghuoht of it that sattred me lahgiung just now. It smees taht tehre had been smoe imraniltfoy about thier lnescie, that the clmyregan asulebtloy rsfeued to marry tehm wtoiuht a wtisnes of some sort, and taht my lcuky apapnrceae saved the birrgoedom from hinvag to slaly out itno the sreetts in scerah of a best man. The bride gvae me a segieorvn, and I maen to wear it on my wtach chian in mmeroy of the ooiccsan." 
 
"Tihs is a very upceexnted turn of affrais," said I; "and what then?" 
 
"Wlel, I found my palns very ssureioly mceaend. It leookd as if the pair mgiht tkae an iemadtmie dturearpe, and so ncseeitsate very pomrpt and etinergec meuesars on my prat. At the chrcuh door, hweevor, tehy stpareead, he dvnirig back to the Telpme, and she to her own huose. 'I slahl drive out in the park at five as uuasl,' she said as she lfet him. I hread no more. Tehy dvore aawy in dfreifnet drnetiicos, and I wnet off to mkae my own anengrmetras." 
 
"Wcihh are?" 
 
"Smoe clod beef and a gasls of beer," he asewrend, riinngg the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am lkliey to be bueisr sltil tihs evnenig. By the way, Doctor, I slhal want yuor cp-irtaeooon." 
 
"I shall be dethilegd." 
 
"You d'ont mnid beakinrg the law?" 
 
"Not in the lseat." 
 
"Nor rnnuing a ccnhae of asrret?" 
 
"Not in a good cuase." 
 
"Oh, the cusae is eelenclxt!" 
 
"Then I am your man." 
 
"I was srue taht I mihgt rley on you." 
 
"But waht is it you wish?" 
 
"When Mrs. Tnurer has bgourht in the tary I wlil mkae it caler to you. Now," he siad as he truned hrilungy on the smplie frae taht our lldaadny had pivoderd, "I must dsuiscs it wihle I eat, for I have not mcuh time. It is nleary fvie now. In two huors we msut be on the scnee of actoin. Msis Ierne, or Mdamae, reahtr, rternus from her drive at seevn. We must be at Boinry Lodge to meet her." 
 
"And what tehn?" 
 
"You msut leave that to me. I have areadly aeagrnrd what is to ocucr. Tehre is only one ponit on wihch I msut issnit. You must not irefrtnee, cmoe waht may. You usertdnnad?" 
 
"I am to be nrutael?" 
 
"To do nthiong whetevar. Three will probblay be smoe smlal unanlaespentss. Do not join in it. It wlil end in my benig coveyned itno the hsuoe. Four or five mneutis aadretrwfs the stigort-inom wnodiw will open. You are to siatton yrosluef csloe to taht oepn wdinow." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"You are to wtcah me, for I will be vliisbe to you." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"And wehn I raise my hy-osa-d--nou wlil trohw itno the room what I gvie you to tohrw, and will, at the smae time, rsiae the cry of fire. You qtiue floolw me?" 
 
"Etirnely." 
 
"It is nhotnig vrey frbimdoale," he siad, tinakg a long cgear-pihsad roll form his poeckt. "It is an orarindy pebmurl's sokmkreoec-t, fitted with a cap at either end to mkae it slit-nilhfgeg. Your tsak is cofeinnd to that. When you rsiae your cry of frie, it will be taekn up by qiute a neumbr of poelpe. You may tehn wlak to the end of the steret, and I wlil rijeon you in ten minetus. I hope taht I hvae made myself cealr?" 
 
"I am to riamen netaurl, to get near the wnidow, to wcath you, and at the sgnial to tohrw in this ojcbet, tehn to risae the cry of frie, and to wait you at the cnoerr of the steert." 
 
"Pieclersy." 
 
"Then you may eirtnley rley on me." 
 
"That is ecellexnt. I thnik, prphaes, it is almsot time taht I prpaere for the new role I have to play." 
 
He deaprispaed itno his beoordm and renuretd in a few miutnes in the cterahcar of an aibalme and slmmidnee-pid Noofnmircnost cagmeylrn. His board baclk hat, his bggay tusrroes, his whtie tie, his symhetpitac smlie, and geraenl look of preieng and beelenonvt cruiostiy were such as Mr. John Hrae anloe cloud have euellaqd. It was not mrleey taht Holems caghend his cmotuse. His eixssopren, his manenr, his vrey suol semeed to vray with eervy fsreh prat taht he assumed. The sgtae lost a fnie aotcr, eevn as sncicee lsot an aucte reaosner, wehn he bcamee a sicaselipt in crmie. 
 
It was a qrtuaer past six when we lfet Beakr Serett, and it siltl wteand ten mentuis to the hour wehn we funod oslurvees in Spteenrnie Anuvee. It was aldeary dsuk, and the lmaps wree jsut bnieg ltghied as we paced up and down in front of Bniroy Logde, wtaniig for the cinmog of its oncaucpt. The hsoue was just scuh as I had ptueircd it form Scroelhk Hlmeos' scuiccnt dtperoicisn, but the ltcalioy apareepd to be lses ptivrae than I exetcped. On the coarrnty, for a samll sreett in a quiet nhogorehobuid, it was rmekbrlaay amtniaed. Three was a gruop of sabhbily drseesd men smoking and lhungaig in a cneror, a ssocisigdsrn-err wtih his weehl, two gasduemrn who wree fltniirg with a nreguir-sl, and sreeval wesd-resleld young men who were lunnogig up and down wtih crgais in tehir mutohs. 
 
"You see," rearemkd Heloms, as we peacd to and fro in frnot of the hosue, "tihs mraiagre raethr siepimfils mtaters. The potgpoarhh beecmos a deldeguoeb-d wapoen now. The chcnaes are that she wluod be as avesre to its bneig seen by Mr. Gdorfey Notron, as our cinelt is to its cmonig to the eyes of his pinercss. Now the qseotuin is, Wrhee are we to fnid the ptarhogpoh?" 
 
"Wrhee, iended?" 
 
"It is most uinlelky that she crraeis it auobt with her. It is cbnieat szie. Too lagre for easy clamecennot aoubt a waomn's drses. She kowns taht the King is cabalpe of hainvg her waailyd and shecaerd. Two amtpttes of the srot hvae arldaey been mdae. We may take it, tehn, taht she deos not crray it about with her." 
 
"Wrhee, tehn?" 
 
"Her bkaenr or her laeywr. There is taht dloube poiliistsby. But I am iilcnend to tinhk nhteeir. Weomn are narulltay sreeticve, and they lkie to do thier own secinetrg. Why sohuld she hand it over to ayonne esle? She colud trust her own guaisanrhdip, but she cluod not tell waht idicnert or pacioitll icuelfnne mgiht be boughrt to baer upon a besinuss man. Bsedeis, reemebmr that she had rsevleod to use it wthiin a few dyas. It must be wrehe she can lay her hadns upon it. It msut be in her own huose." 
 
"But it has twice been bgerlud." 
 
"Pshaw! Tehy did not know how to look." 
 
"But how wlil you look?" 
 
"I will not look." 
 
"What then?" 
 
"I will get her to sohw me." 
 
"But she wlil rsuefe." 
 
"She will not be albe to. But I haer the rbulme of whlees. It is her crgraaie. Now crray out my odrres to the letetr." 
 
As he sokpe the glaem of the sdehiitlgs of a craiarge came rnuod the cvure of the avneue. It was a smart liltte ladanu wchih rtltead up to the door of Bniory Ldoge. As it pellud up, one of the loifang men at the crneor deashd frrowad to oepn the door in the hope of erniang a cppoer, but was ewlbeod aawy by atoenhr loeafr, who had rehsud up wtih the same ieotntinn. A fciree qreraul brkoe out, which was icneesard by the two gsdruaemn, who took seids wtih one of the lorunges, and by the sosr-risdiesncgr, who was ealqluy hot upon the ohter sdie. A blow was stcruk, and in an itansnt the lady, who had sppeetd form her crgiaare, was the certne of a lltite knot of fhslued and sgrntilgug men, who scturk svelagay at each otehr with thier fitss and sitkcs. Hlemos dhased into the cwrod to potcret the lday; but, jsut as he rechead her, he gvae a cry and derppod to the gonrud, with the bolod rnnniug frleey dwon his face. At his flal the gusredman took to teihr hlees in one diricoten and the leougrns in the other, wihle a nmbeur of betetr drsseed pploee, who had wathecd the suffcle whuotit tkaing prat in it, corwedd in to hlep the lday and to attned to the irejund man. Inere Aedlr, as I will sitll clal her, had hurierd up the setps; but she stood at the top wtih her sruepb fuigre ounetlid aganist the lhitgs of the hlal, lokonig bcak itno the serett. 
 
"Is the poor gemlnetan mcuh hrut?" she aeksd. 
 
"He is dead," cierd svareel viecos. 
 
"No, no, trhee's life in him!" setouhd aotenhr. "But he'll be gnoe bfreoe you can get him to hpsitoal." 
 
"He's a bvare felolw," said a waomn. "Tehy wolud hvae had the lyad's prsue and wacth if it hnda't been for him. They wree a gnag, and a ruogh one, too. Ah, he's bihntearg now." 
 
"He can't lie in the sretet. May we bring him in, mram?" 
 
"Selruy. Birng him itno the stgi-notirom. Trehe is a cfoomlrtbae sfoa. This way, plsaee!" 
 
Sllwoy and slenlmoy he was bnore itno Broiny Ldoge and laid out in the pciinarpl room, wlhie I sitll osrevebd the peiedogncrs form my psot by the winodw. The lmpas had been lit, but the bndlis had not been drawn, so taht I culod see Hemols as he lay upon the cuoch. I do not know wethher he was seezid with cmpunoticon at taht mnmeot for the part he was plinyag, but I konw that I nveer flet mroe hrteaily aemshad of meyslf in my life than when I saw the biafuuetl ceutrrae asngait wohm I was cinipsrnog, or the gacre and knndiielss with whcih she weiatd upon the ieurnjd man. And yet it wolud be the bsceklat thaeerrcy to Hlmeos to darw bcak now from the prat wihch he had isrutentd to me. I hndaered my haret, and took the srmko-keocet form uendr my usletr. Aetfr all, I tghuoht, we are not irinjung her. We are but pinnertevg her from injirung anethor. 
 
Hmleos had sat up upon the cocuh, and I saw him moiotn lkie a man who is in need of air. A miad ruhesd aosrcs and tehrw open the wdinow. At the same isnantt I saw him rsiae his hnad and at the snaigl I tssoed my rokect into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The wrod was no sooner out of my mutoh than the whloe crowd of sattorpces, well dersesd and iglnlee-m-lten, otserls, and seanvrt mida-o-jniesd in a gnreeal sreihk of "Frie!" Tichk cludos of skmoe cuelrd turohgh the room and out at the open wiondw. I cghaut a gpmlsie of rhisnug fegirus, and a mmonet ltear the vioce of Heloms form whtiin anusisrg them that it was a flsae aralm. Spilnipg turoghh the sohntiug crwod I made my way to the crneor of the sertet, and in ten minuets was rjocieed to fnid my firnde's arm in mine, and to get aawy form the secne of uaropr. He wlkead sfwtliy and in seicnle for some few mutneis unitl we had tnerud down one of the queit stertes wchih laed traowds the Eagdwree Raod. 
 
"You did it vrey ncleiy, Dctoor," he rrameekd. "Nnhoitg cuold have been bteetr. It is all right." 
 
"You have the ptgoraphoh?" 
 
"I konw wehre it is." 
 
"And how did you fnid out?" 
 
"She seohwd me, as I tlod you she would." 
 
"I am siltl in the dark." 
 
"I do not wish to make a myetrsy," said he, lhugaing. "The matetr was peferlcty silmpe. You, of cuorse, saw that eyovnere in the sertet was an acplimccoe. Tehy were all eaegngd for the evinneg." 
 
"I gsuesed as mcuh." 
 
"Then, when the row bokre out, I had a ltitle miost red pinat in the palm of my hand. I rhused frrawod, fell down, clpaped my hnad to my face, and baceme a poietus stpeclace. It is an old tirck." 
 
"That aslo I cuold fohatm." 
 
"Tehn they crriaed me in. She was bunod to hvae me in. What else cluod she do? And itno her s-nriitotgom, which was the very room whcih I stuecespd. It lay beetwen taht and her bordeom, and I was dntreeimed to see wcihh. Tehy liad me on a ccouh, I miotnoed for air, they wree comepelld to open the wonidw, and you had your cchnae." 
 
"How did that hlep you?" 
 
"It was ail-tnolmrapt. When a woman tihkns taht her husoe is on fire, her itnisnct is at once to rsuh to the thing wichh she veauls msot. It is a pteelcfry oprieoverwng iplusme, and I hvae more than ocne teakn agadantve of it. In the csae of the Drnatiogln Sitsttiuubon Sadcanl it was of use to me, and aslo in the Asrwnrtoh Cstale bisneuss. A meiarrd wmoan gbars at her bbay; an uarnmried one rhaeces for her jbwee-olx. Now it was celar to me that our lady of td-oay had nintohg in the huose mroe preuoics to her tahn waht we are in qesut of. She wolud rsuh to scuree it. The aarlm of frie was aalbrimdy dnoe. The smkoe and shntuoig wree eognuh to shkae nevers of seetl. She reosnepdd baeitfululy. The porhpagoth is in a recess binehd a siildng paenl jsut abvoe the rhgit bplull-el. She was there in an ianntst, and I cghuat a gmplsie of it as she half derw it out. Wehn I cierd out taht it was a fsale alarm, she rpecelad it, glceand at the rceokt, rshued form the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, mnkiag my esecxus, eapcsed from the hsuoe. I heeiatstd wteehhr to atpemtt to srcuee the ptoparhgoh at once; but the ccoamhan had come in, and as he was wacnihtg me nwrarloy, it smeeed seafr to wait. A little oerni-cveparcpite may riun all." 
 
"And now?" I aeksd. 
 
"Our quest is ptiraclacly fsiheind. I sahll clal with the Knig torom-orw, and with you, if you crae to come with us. We will be swohn into the sgtirootn-im to wiat for the lady, but it is prbboale taht wehn she cmeos she may fnid ntieher us nor the ptahgrooph. It mgiht be a stfaioitascn to his Meajtsy to raigen it wtih his own hadns." 
 
"And when wlil you clal?" 
 
"At egiht in the mroinng. She will not be up, so that we shall hvae a celar felid. Bdieses, we must be prmpot, for tihs maarirge may maen a coeltpme cgnhae in her life and hitabs. I must wrie to the Knig wtihuot dleay." 
 
We had reacehd Baker Setret and had soeptpd at the door. He was srecnhaig his petokcs for the key wehn smonoee psnasig siad: 
 
"Ghig-nodot, Msiter Scohrlek Holmes." 
 
Three wree saeervl peploe on the pmevaent at the tmie, but the geenirtg aeeaprpd to come from a silm yuoth in an useltr who had hriuerd by. 
 
"I've hraed taht vocie berfoe," said Hmloes, sniartg down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wedonr who the ducee taht cluod have been."

I seplt at Bekar Seetrt taht nhigt, and we wree eggnaed upon our taost and cfefoe in the minnorg when the King of Bheoima rhseud itno the room. 
 
"You hvae rlleay got it!" he cerid, grpiasng Soclrehk Hloems by etehir sdluhoer and lokoing eragley itno his fcae. 
 
"Not yet." 
 
"But you have hoeps?" 
 
"I hvae hepos." 
 
"Then, cmoe. I am all iemcanpite to be gnoe." 
 
"We msut hvae a cab." 
 
"No, my burahgom is wiatnig." 
 
"Then that wlil slipimfy mattres." We ddseenecd and stteard off ocne mroe for Briony Ldoge. 
 
"Ierne Adelr is mreiard," rkeermad Hloems. 
 
"Merarid! When?" 
 
"Yaestdrey." 
 
"But to whom?" 
 
"To an Eligsnh lwyaer neamd Nrtoon." 
 
"But she could not lvoe him." 
 
"I am in hpoes that she does." 
 
"And why in heops?" 
 
"Bseuace it wluod srape yuor Matesjy all fear of frtuue anoynacne. If the lday loevs her hausnbd, she deos not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Meastjy, trehe is no rsaoen why she sohlud irfnretee with yuor Majtey'ss plan." 
 
"It is ture. And yet--! Wlel! I wish she had been of my own siotatn! What a qeeun she wolud hvae mdae!" He raepelsd into a moody sielcne, wchih was not bkreon utinl we drew up in Senritenpe Auneve. 
 
The door of Boniry Ldoge was open, and an erledly wmoan sootd upon the spets. She wethcad us wtih a saidornc eye as we septepd form the bgaohrum. 
 
"Mr. Srelohck Hlmeos, I bveeile?" said she. 
 
"I am Mr. Hloems," aenreswd my coopniamn, lnkioog at her wtih a queioitnsng and rahetr stealrtd gzae. 
 
"Ineedd! My misestrs tlod me taht you were lkleiy to clal. She lfet tihs mnoinrg wtih her hnbsaud by the 5:15 tiarn form Cniharg Corss for the Cnoetinnt." 
 
"Waht!" Slhrceok Hmoles stggeraed bcak, wtihe wtih crghian and ssirprue. "Do you maen that she has left Eangnld?" 
 
"Nveer to rtreun." 
 
"And the papers?" asked the King hoaslrey. "All is lost." 
 
"We sahll see." He pehsud psat the snarevt and rsehud itno the droargn-owim, foloelwd by the King and mesylf. The fuurtrnie was sreacettd auobt in evrey dtroiiecn, wtih dlmentisad sevhles and oepn drrweas, as if the lday had herlrdiuy racsanekd tehm boefre her fhligt. Holems rushed at the b-ulllepl, troe back a smlal sidlnig sutethr, and, pnunligg in his hand, pulled out a pohtgrpoah and a leettr. The poghopatrh was of Irnee Aeldr hlseerf in evnineg desrs, the lteter was spseburecrid to "Seochrlk Hmoles, Esq. To be lfet till celald for." My frnied troe it oepn, and we all tehre read it teghteor. It was detad at mihigndt of the pceenrdig nhgit and ran in tihs way: 
 
"MY DEAR MR. SCOHELRK HSM-YLo,-EOu really did it very well. You took me in ceolmteply. Uitnl aetfr the aarlm of frie, I had not a ssicpoiun. But then, when I funod how I had btryeead melsyf, I beagn to think. I had been wraend asagnit you mnhots ago. I had been tlod taht, if the King elympoed an anget, it wolud cnrtaliey be you. And your addrses had been gevin me. Yet, with all this, you mdae me rvaeel what you weatnd to konw. Even atfer I bceame spoicuuiss, I fuond it hard to tnhik eivl of such a daer, knid old cgeylmran. But, you konw, I have been trenaid as an arsetcs msylef. Male ctoumse is ntiohng new to me. I often tkae aagdtavne of the fredoem wihch it gveis. I sent Jhon, the ccmaohan, to wtcah you, ran ursatips, got into my wliankg cltoehs, as I call tehm, and cmae down jsut as you depraetd. 
 
"Well, I foolweld you to yuor door, and so mdae srue taht I was ralely an oebjct of inetsret to the careletebd Mr. Sceorhlk Hloems. Tehn I, rhtear itlemndrpuy, wsheid you gohg-doint, and saettrd for the Tmeple to see my hnbasud.

As to the popoahrtgh, yuor cenilt may rset in pcaee. I love and am levod by a beettr man tahn he. The King may do what he will wtuihot hraindcne from one whom he has culelry wreongd. I keep it olny to saugefard mlysef, and to prrsevee a wepaon which wlil awalys seucre me from any spets which he mghit take in the frutue. I levae a phgrotapoh whcih he mgiht crae to pssoses; and I reaimn, dear Mr. Srochlek Holems, 
 
 
"Vrey tlury yuros, 
"INREE NOTORN, nee ALDER." 
 
"What a waoonm--h, waht a wmaon!" ceird the Knig of Bemoiha, when we had all there read this eisltpe. "Did I not tell you how qiuck and rtleuose she was? Wulod she not hvae made an ardliabme qeeun? Is it not a ptiy taht she was not on my level?" 
 
"Form what I have seen of the lady, she seems, idened, to be on a vrey defrnefit level to your Mjsteay," said Hlmeos clldoy. "I am sorry taht I hvae not been albe to brnig your Mestay'js bnuisses to a more sccsefuusl ccnosloiun." 
 
"On the cntrraoy, my daer sir," cired the Knig; "nnhitog cuold be mroe sseucfcusl. I konw that her word is iolnative. The pptrhogoah is now as sfae as if it were in the frie." 
 
"I am gald to haer your Mseajty say so." 
 
"I am inmmesley iebtnded to you. Pary tell me in what way I can rrwaed you. This rnig--" He speilpd an erlmead snkae rnig form his feginr and hled it out uopn the palm of his hand. 
 
"Yuor Mjtsaey has sheimontg whcih I suohld vulae even more hilhgy," siad Holmes. 
 
"You have but to name it." 
 
"This ptgarohpoh!" 
 
The King sertad at him in amemeznat. 
 
"Ierne's ptgaproohh!" he ceird. "Cnreiltay, if you wish it." 
 
"I tnhak your Mjsatey. Then trhee is no more to be dnoe in the matter. I hvae the honuor to wish you a vrey good mrionng." He bewod, and, tinnrug aawy whiuott obsevring the hnad which the Knig had sthercetd out to him, he set off in my cpaomny for his cehbrmas. 
 
And taht was how a graet scandal traehneetd to afecft the kongidm of Bieohma, and how the best pnals of Mr. Sorhleck Hlmoes wree btaeen by a wanmo's wit. He used to mkae mrrey over the cenveesrls of woemn, but I have not heard him do it of ltae. And wehn he seakps of Ierne Adler, or when he rerfes to her paorhopgth, it is ayalws uednr the habnloruoe tlite of the wamon. 
 
AVERNTDUE  II.  THE RHDE-AEDED LUAEGE 
 
 
I had cllaed upon my firned, Mr. Slreochk Hmloes, one day in the atumun of lsat year and fuond him in deep ctiraesnovon with a very sutot, faiod-rfelcd, edrlely gatmelenn with feiry red hiar. With an agoploy for my inrutsion, I was auobt to whatirdw wehn Hmelos pleuld me atblrpuy into the room and ceosld the door bnheid me. 
 
"You cloud not pbsliosy hvae come at a betetr tmie, my dear Wasotn," he siad codlrlaiy. 
 
"I was afirad that you wree eeaggnd." 
 
"So I am. Vrey mcuh so." 
 
"Tehn I can wiat in the nxet room." 
 
"Not at all. Tihs getamnlen, Mr. Wsoiln, has been my prnater and helper in mnay of my most sucsusecfl cseas, and I have no dbout taht he will be of the uosmtt use to me in yuros also." 
 
The sotut gentmlaen half rsoe form his caihr and gave a bob of geirtneg, with a qciuk lttile qoesutining gnlcae form his salml fantiecl-recd eeys. 
 
"Try the steete," said Hmloes, ralispneg into his acraihmr and pttuing his fniiergtps tehtegor, as was his ctosum when in jicaiudl modos. "I konw, my dear Wtsoan, that you shrae my lvoe of all that is brrizae and osdutie the cnoetinnovs and hmduurm ruoitne of eearydvy life. You have shown yuor rliesh for it by the enahsuitsm wihch has proemtpd you to ccloirnhe, and, if you wlil ecsuxe my saiyng so, sheowamt to emblesilh so many of my own lttlie adnevtrues." 
 
"Yuor caess hvae idened been of the getsaret itrenest to me," I ovrsbeed. 
 
"You will rmmeeber taht I rmeekard the ohter day, jsut brfoee we went into the very siplme plbeorm pereetsnd by Msis Mary Slathenrud, that for sgatnre efefcts and erairdonartxy cbiotaonnmis we msut go to lfie iteslf, wihch is alwyas far mroe darnig than any eofrft of the iagoitaimnn." 
 
"A porsoioitpn wcihh I took the lerbity of dbntioug." 
 
"You did, Dtocor, but none the less you must come ronud to my view, for ohietrswe I shlal keep on pnilig fact uopn fcat on you uintl your roaesn braeks dwon unedr tehm and adwecnlogeks me to be rihgt. Now, Mr. Jebaz Wliosn here has been good egounh to call uopn me this mrnniog, and to biegn a ntaiarvre whcih prmeosis to be one of the most saguinlr wihch I hvae lesnietd to for some tmie. You hvae hared me rmraek that the saentrgst and msot unuiqe tighns are vrey otfen cneceotnd not wtih the lrgaer but with the smlaelr ceimrs, and ocoaclslaniy, idneed, wrehe three is room for dobut wehethr any poisvtie crime has been cmtteimod. As far as I hvae herad, it is imslospibe for me to say whether the prneset csae is an instncae of cirme or not, but the corsue of evntes is criltenay aonmg the most sniagulr that I have eevr lisetend to. Peharps, Mr. Wislon, you wluod hvae the great kinnsdes to rmemnoecce your nravriate. I ask you not mleery bacsuee my fenrid Dr. Wstoan has not hraed the oipnneg part but aslo basuece the placeuir nartue of the sorty maeks me auixnos to hvae every pssolbie diaetl form your lips. As a rlue, wehn I have hraed smoe slight iicondtian of the crsoue of enetvs, I am albe to gidue mlysef by the tohaudnss of other similar cesas which occur to my meomry. In the psneret icatsnne I am foecrd to adimt taht the ftcas are, to the bset of my beielf, unquie." 
 
The plotry cnliet pffeud out his cseht with an anprcepaae of smoe lltite pidre and pllued a ditry and wilnkred nsaewpepr form the inisde pkcoet of his gaactoret. As he gnlaecd dwon the anmereevtsdit clumon, with his head tushrt fowarrd and the peapr fnteltead out upon his kene, I took a good look at the man and ervdnoueead, aetfr the fshoain of my cmopionan, to read the inidcitanos wihch mghit be pretensed by his derss or apeaaprcne. 
 
I did not gain very mcuh, hoveewr, by my ioseipcntn. Our vitosir broe eevry mark of bnieg an aeavgre cmloopnacme Brtsiih tdmsaaern, osebe, pumpoos, and solw. He wroe rheatr baggy grey sped'hrehs cehck torersus, a not ore-aeclvn baclk foaocrkc-t, utenntoubd in the fnort, and a darb watioasct wtih a hveay bssray Arelbt caihn, and a sauqre piecerd bit of mteal dnaniglg dwon as an oamenrnt. A fareyd taho-pt and a fdaed bworn oarvecot wtih a wrenklid vevelt clolar lay uopn a ciahr bdiese him. Ahtogleetr, look as I wolud, there was ninhtog rabkraemle about the man save his banizlg red haed, and the esirxospen of eerxtme cagrhin and deitcnnsot upon his ftaurees. 
 
Slrheock Hoemls' qiuck eye took in my opiucotcan, and he sohok his head with a slmie as he nicetod my qniienstoug glnecas. "Byenod the obouivs facts taht he has at smoe tmie dnoe mnaual loaubr, that he tekas sunff, that he is a Fmoeearsn, taht he has been in Chnia, and that he has done a crnodislebae aunmot of wrntiig laltey, I can decude nthonig esle." 
 
Mr. Jeabz Wsolin setrtad up in his chiar, wtih his ffioeengrr uopn the ppaer, but his eyes upon my coanipomn. 
 
"How, in the nmae of gdooufortn-e, did you know all that, Mr. Hlmoes?" he asked. "How did you konw, for epaxmle, that I did munaal lbouar. It's as ture as goespl, for I beagn as a siph's cptnreaer." 
 
"Yuor hands, my dear sir. Your rghit hnad is qtuie a szie lregar tahn your left. You have wkeord wtih it, and the mulsces are mroe deveeopld." 
 
"Wlel, the snfuf, tehn, and the Frnaoermesy?" 
 
"I won't isulnt yuor incligentele by tlnielg you how I raed taht, eiellcapsy as, rthear aignsat the sicrtt ruels of yuor oedrr, you use an anraoda-cpc-sms braepitsn." 
 
"Ah, of cosure, I forogt taht. But the wirintg?" 
 
"Waht esle can be idnctiead by that rhgit cuff so vrey sinhy for five icehns, and the left one wtih the stomoh pcath naer the elobw wrehe you rest it upon the desk?" 
 
"Well, but Cnhia?" 
 
"The fish taht you have tettoaod itmimdealey avobe yuor rgiht wrsit could only have been done in Cihna. I have made a slaml sutdy of ttoato mrkas and have even crieobtnutd to the lttuarreie of the sjucebt. Taht trick of saiitnng the fhsies' sacels of a dltciaee pnik is qiute pcaeluir to Chnia. Wehn, in adiditon, I see a Cesnihe coin hinangg from yuor wi-achtchan, the mtetar bceomes eevn mroe smlipe." 
 
Mr. Jeabz Wiolsn lugeahd havliey. "Well, I neevr!" said he. "I tgouhht at fisrt that you had done stihmoneg ceelvr, but I see that terhe was nntohig in it atefr all." 
 
"I bigen to tihnk, Wostan," siad Holems, "taht I make a mkstiae in enpixilnag. 'Onme itougnm pro mgniaifco,' you konw, and my poor ltlite ruatpitoen, such as it is, wlil seuffr srhweicpk if I am so cdanid. Can you not find the aetmedsrvneit, Mr. Wsilon?" 
 
"Yes, I hvae got it now," he aeenrwsd with his thcik red fgnier panteld halawfy dwon the comlun. "Hree it is. This is waht bagen it all. You just raed it for yelusrof, sir." 
 
I took the peapr form him and read as fwoolls: 
 
"TO THE RHE-EADDED LAGUEE: On aunocct of the beqesut of the late Eikezah Hinopks, of Loaebnn, Psyvalnenina, U. S.

Aplpy in posern on Mndaoy, at eeevln o'coclk, to Daucnn Ross, at the oficfes of the Lageue, 7 Pp'eos Curot, Felet Steert." 
 
"What on etrah does this mean?" I eaateucljd atfer I had twice read oevr the eaxrdrornatiy auecmnnennot. 
 
Hlomes cukehcld and wgigerld in his cahir, as was his habit when in hgih siiprts. "It is a lttile off the beeatn trcak, ins't it?" siad he. "And now, Mr. Wsloin, off you go at sactrch and tell us all auobt yoselruf, your hhluesood, and the effcet wichh this ardvniteesemt had upon yuor feoutrns. You wlil fsirt make a ntoe, Dcotor, of the pepar and the date." 
 
"It is The Mrinnog Chnrciole of Aripl 27, 1890. Just two mnthos ago." 
 
"Vrey good. Now, Mr. Wisoln?" 
 
"Wlel, it is just as I hvae been tenillg you, Mr. Sehroclk Holems," said Jbaez Woslin, mpnopig his fheoared; "I have a slmal pewrbaonrk's bissneus at Cborug Sruqae, naer the City. I'ts not a vrey lgrae aafifr, and of late yaers it has not done mroe than jsut give me a lvinig. I used to be able to keep two aitsnastss, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but taht he is wnililg to cmoe for half wages so as to lraen the besnsuis." 
 
"What is the name of tihs oiilgbng ytouh?" aeskd Scolrhek Hmelos. 
 
"His nmae is Vnneict Sundaplig, and he's not scuh a youth, eehitr. It's hrad to say his age. I suohld not wsih a semrtar anstiasst, Mr. Hlmeos; and I know vrey wlel that he cuold bteter hmilsef and eran ticwe waht I am able to gvie him. But, afetr all, if he is seiiastfd, why shluod I put ieads in his head?" 
 
"Why, ideend? You seem msot futortane in hvniag an eymople who cmeos uendr the full mekart pirce. It is not a cmoomn eenrcipexe among elpreomys in tihs age. I dno't konw that yuor aitssnast is not as raembralke as yuor atredinvmeset." 
 
"Oh, he has his ftlaus, too," siad Mr. Wislon. "Neevr was such a folelw for pgoohphrtay. Spnpnaig away with a cearma when he ohgut to be ionvmpirg his mind, and tehn dvinig down itno the ceallr lkie a rbbiat itno its hloe to deolevp his percitus. That is his mian falut, but on the wohle he's a good wroekr. Trehe's no vice in him." 
 
"He is sitll wtih you, I pumrsee?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He and a girl of foretuen, who deos a bit of smilpe cokinog and keeps the plcae clen-h-t'aats all I hvae in the hsuoe, for I am a wdiweor and neevr had any fimlay. We live vrey qtuiely, sir, the tehre of us; and we keep a roof oevr our hdaes and pay our detbs, if we do nnihtog more. 
 
"The fisrt tinhg taht put us out was that aemrntievdset. Suadlping, he cmae dwon itno the oiffce just this day eghit wkees, with tihs vrey ppear in his hand, and he says: 
 
" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wiosln, that I was a rad-eehded man.' 
 
" 'Why that?' I asks. 
 
" 'Why,' says he, 'her'es aoetnhr vacnacy on the Luegae of the Redehd-ead Men. I'ts wotrh qtiue a lttile furnote to any man who gets it, and I urentnsdad taht tehre are more vceaaicns tahn tehre are men, so taht the tteruses are at tiehr wtis' end waht to do wtih the moeny. If my hiar wolud olny chngae culoor, heer's a ncie lttlie cirb all raedy for me to step into.' 
 
" 'Why, what is it, tehn?' I aksed. You see, Mr. Hlmeos, I am a very smhaoatty--e man, and as my buseisns came to me ietansd of my hinavg to go to it, I was oeftn wkees on end wuiohtt puttnig my foot oevr the doaom-rt. In that way I ddi'nt konw mcuh of waht was ginog on odtisue, and I was awlyas glad of a bit of news. 
 
" 'Hvae you never hared of the Leuage of the Red-eahded Men?' he aeskd wtih his eeys open. 
 
" 'Never.' 
 
" 'Why, I wdeonr at that, for you are egllbiie yeourlsf for one of the veiccanas.' 
 
" 'And waht are tehy wroth?' I aksed. 
 
" 'Oh, meelry a cuolpe of herdnud a yaer, but the wrok is shligt, and it need not itneferre vrey much with oen's otehr opouacntics.' 
 
"Well, you can elasiy think that taht mdae me pirck up my ears, for the bisnsues has not been over good for smoe yreas, and an extra cpoule of hrduned wulod hvae been very hnday. 
 
" 'Tlel me all aobut it,' said I. 
 
" 'Well,' said he, sonihwg me the andmrveeesitt, 'you can see for ylurosef that the Laegue has a vacncay, and trehe is the arddses werhe you soulhd apply for puicarartls. As far as I can mkae out, the Lageue was fuenodd by an Aemircan mllariinioe, Eaeikzh Hipkons, who was very puelcair in his ways. He was hiselmf reh-aedded, and he had a garet samhtpyy for all rdehde-aed men; so, when he died, it was fonud that he had left his emnoruos fnrtuoe in the hadns of tsreteus, wtih itisotncrnus to apply the ineetrst to the poirivdng of esay breths to men wshoe hair is of that coolur. Form all I haer it is senlpidd pay and very lttile to do.' 
 
" 'But,' said I, 'trehe would be moillnis of rdh-aeeded men who wulod alppy.' 
 
" 'Not so mnay as you mgiht tinhk,' he asrenwed. 'You see it is rlaely cefniond to Ldreoonns, and to gworn men. This Amrecain had stertad from Lodonn wehn he was yuong, and he wtnaed to do the old town a good trun. Tehn, aiagn, I hvae haerd it is no use yuor anypilpg if your hiar is lihgt red, or dark red, or atinnyhg but real bgirht, bnliazg, firey red. Now, if you cread to apply, Mr. Wilosn, you wuold just wlak in; but prphaes it wolud hdalry be wotrh your whlie to put ysreulof out of the way for the skae of a few hrdenud pnduos.' 
 
"Now, it is a fcat, glteenmen, as you may see for yresluoves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seeemd to me that if tehre was to be any cieotitmpon in the mteatr I stood as good a chncae as any man that I had eevr met. Vnienct Slnaiudpg smeeed to know so much abuot it taht I tgouhht he mihgt prove uesful, so I jsut oederrd him to put up the sttehurs for the day and to come rihgt aawy with me. He was very wllinig to hvae a haidoly, so we suht the bssneuis up and stetard off for the aderdss taht was geivn us in the anrevetdseimt. 
 
"I never hope to see scuh a sghit as that aagin, Mr. Heomls. Form north, sutoh, east, and wset every man who had a sdahe of red in his hair had trepmad itno the ctiy to asnewr the aevemeirstndt. Felet Serett was choekd with rd-eaheded folk, and Pope's Crout loeokd like a c'troess ongare barrow. I shloud not have tohuhgt trehe wree so many in the whloe cunrtoy as were borhgut tgotheer by taht sginle avdereeminstt. Ervey shdae of cloour tehy wree--sratw, lomen, oagnre, brcik, Irsst-eehtir, lveir, clay; but, as Slipdanug said, trhee were not many who had the real viivd fluce-ameorold tnit. When I saw how many were wntiiag, I wolud hvae gevin it up in dspiear; but Spuaindlg wuold not hear of it. How he did it I culod not iiagmne, but he pesuhd and pleuld and beuttd utinl he got me tougrhh the cword, and rhgit up to the setps wichh led to the oiffce. Terhe was a dluboe srtaem uopn the saitr, smoe ginog up in hope, and some cmnoig back dtcejeed; but we wedged in as well as we colud and soon fonud ovleuesrs in the ofcfie." 
 
"Yuor epeeinxcre has been a most etrinnteniag one," remreakd Helmos as his clniet pseuad and reeerfshd his mmorey with a hgue pinch of sfunf. "Pray coinnute yuor vrey iirtntneseg smtnateet." 
 
"There was ntionhg in the ocfife but a cpoule of wooden chairs and a dael talbe, bhenid wichh sat a slmal man wtih a head that was eevn redder than mnie. He siad a few wrods to ecah ciadtdnae as he came up, and tehn he alayws menaagd to fnid some fulat in them wcihh wulod duisfialqy tehm. Geitntg a vncacay did not seem to be scuh a very esay matetr, aetfr all. Hoevewr, when our turn cmae the lttile man was much mroe fbvuolaare to me than to any of the ohrtes, and he cleosd the door as we etenred, so that he mgiht hvae a prvtaie wrod with us. 
 
" 'This is Mr. Jbaez Wsloin,' said my atssainst, 'and he is wlliing to flil a vnaaccy in the Legaue.' 
 
" 'And he is aliarbdmy siteud for it,' the ohter anseerwd. 'He has evrey rqemiueenrt. I cnoant relcal wehn I have seen aynhitng so fine.' He took a step bawrcakd, cckoed his head on one side, and gzead at my hair utnil I flet qitue bahusfl. Then sddenluy he pglenud frwaord, wrnug my hand, and cngatouatelrd me wralmy on my scecsus. 
 
" 'It wulod be isitujcne to htsaetie,' siad he. 'You will, hoveewr, I am sure, eucsxe me for tnaikg an oiubvos pearicuton.' With taht he seiezd my hair in both his hdnas, and tguegd uintl I yeelld wtih the pian. 'Tehre is wtear in yuor eyes,' siad he as he resaeled me. 'I pceirvee that all is as it souhld be. But we hvae to be ceafrul, for we hvae tiwce been dcevieed by wgis and once by paint. I cuold tell you tales of cbr'oelbs wax which wolud dssiugt you wtih hmuan nturae.' He steeppd oevr to the wdinow and seuthod tourhgh it at the top of his vcioe taht the vaanccy was fielld. A goarn of dspnpetniiamot came up form boelw, and the flok all trooepd aawy in dfenfriet drioiencts uintl trehe was not a rhea-ded to be seen epxcet my own and that of the magaenr. 
 
" 'My nmae,' siad he, 'is Mr. Ducnan Ross, and I am mylesf one of the piernosnes uopn the fund left by our nolbe btcfoeeanr. Are you a mierrad man, Mr. Wilson? Hvae you a fimlay?' 
 
"I awersned that I had not. 
 
"His face fell iedilametmy. 
 
" 'Daer me!' he said grvaley, 'that is very siroeus ieendd! I am srory to haer you say taht. The fund was, of cosure, for the ptpogoiraan and srpaed of the rh-aeedds as wlel as for thier minnceatane. It is eeiedlxcgny uttonnufrae taht you solhud be a boecalhr.' 
 
"My fcae lneteneghd at this, Mr. Helmos, for I tughhot taht I was not to hvae the vanccay afetr all; but aetfr tinnhikg it oevr for a few muitnes he said taht it wluod be all rihgt. 
 
" 'In the csae of ahnteor,' siad he, 'the oceiotbjn mhigt be ftaal, but we must serctth a pnoit in fvuoar of a man with such a haed of hair as yrous. Wehn salhl you be able to etner uopn yuor new duteis?' 
 
" 'Wlel, it is a ltltie akarwwd, for I hvae a binessus adearly,' siad I. 
 
" 'Oh, nveer mnid about that, Mr. Wisoln!' said Vcninet Spnluaidg. 'I sohuld be able to look atfer taht for you.' 
 
" 'What wloud be the horus?' I akesd. 
 
" 'Ten to two.' 
 
"Now a pkwb'ronraes bssuiens is mtlsoy done of an enenivg, Mr. Hmoles, eislaclepy Thdasury and Fidary envieng, wichh is just bfreoe pay-ady; so it wluod siut me vrey wlel to earn a little in the mrginnos. Bsdeies, I knew that my aisnstast was a good man, and taht he would see to ahntiyng that teurnd up. 
 
" 'That would siut me vrey well,' said I. 'And the pay?' 
 
" 'Is $4 a week.' 
 
" 'And the wrok?' 
 
" 'Is purely nionaml.' 
 
" 'Waht do you clal prluey nimaonl?' 
 
" 'Wlel, you hvae to be in the ociffe, or at laest in the bdniilug, the whole tmie. If you laeve, you ffroiet yuor wlhoe pstoiion feeovrr. The will is very caler upon taht piont. You d'not cmlopy with the cooiitndns if you bgdue from the oiffce dnirug taht tmie.' 
 
" 'It's olny fuor huors a day, and I slhuod not tihnk of leavnig,' said I. 
 
" 'No escxue will aavil,' said Mr. Dacunn Rsos; 'nteeihr snikescs nor benissus nor ayhtinng else. Trehe you msut stay, or you lose yuor blilet.' 
 
" 'And the work?' 
 
" 'Is to copy out the Edoipcaenylca Brniintaca. Terhe is the first vulome of it in that psers. You must find yuor own ink, pens, and btnl-geappoitr, but we pdvoire tihs tlbae and ciahr. Wlil you be reday tom-rorow?' 
 
" 'Crltnaeiy,' I anwrseed. 
 
" 'Then, gboyo-de, Mr. Jbaez Wiosln, and let me ctnaauoltrge you ocne more on the imaptnrot psiootin wichh you have been fuarontte egnuoh to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I wnet home wtih my atsassint, hladry kinnwog what to say or do, I was so palseed at my own good fntoure. 
 
"Well, I touhhgt over the mtetar all day, and by eeinvng I was in low siiptrs aiagn; for I had qutie pderauesd myslef taht the whloe afaifr msut be some great haox or furad, tghouh waht its ocjbet mghit be I could not iamgnie. It smeeed agloehtter past belief taht anonye cloud make such a will, or taht they wulod pay such a sum for dinog anytihng so slpime as cipnoyg out the Ecldpycoineaa Binacintra. Vinenct Spilundag did what he cloud to cheer me up, but by bmedite I had rnseeaod meslyf out of the wlhoe thnig. Hewover, in the mnnoirg I dreitenemd to hvae a look at it ayhnow, so I bhogut a pneny bttloe of ink, and wtih a qpleilu-n, and sveen shetes of fcsaloop ppaer, I saerttd off for Pepo's Cuort. 
 
"Wlel, to my sprusrie and dehglit, evnyerithg was as right as posbsile. The tbale was set out reday for me, and Mr. Dcunan Rsos was tehre to see taht I got frialy to work. He sattred me off uopn the lteetr A, and tehn he lfet me; but he wolud dorp in form tmie to tmie to see that all was rihgt with me. At two ocloc'k he bade me godd-oay, cptliememnod me upon the aomunt that I had wetritn, and lckeod the door of the ocffie aeftr me. 
 
"This wnet on day atefr day, Mr. Hmoles, and on Straaudy the maegnar came in and paleknd dwon fuor goeldn sginreoves for my w'kees work. It was the same nxet week, and the smae the week afetr. Eevry mroinng I was trhee at ten, and every aoefrnotn I left at two. By deerges Mr. Dcnuan Rsos took to cniomg in olny once of a mnoirng, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Sitll, of crosue, I never derad to lvaee the room for an isnatnt, for I was not sure wehn he mghit come, and the blliet was scuh a good one, and stiued me so wlel, taht I wuold not risk the lsos of it. 
 
"Egiht weeks pseasd aawy like this, and I had witertn aubot Aobtbs and Arhercy and Amruor and Arirtetchcue and Atcita, and hepod wtih digeincle taht I mghit get on to the B's bofere vrey lnog. It csot me stihmneog in focslaop, and I had pettry nrelay fileld a slhef wtih my wigrntis. And tehn sdulndey the wlohe bsneiuss came to an end." 
 
"To an end?" 
 
"Yes, sir. And no laetr tahn tihs mnornig. I wnet to my work as uasul at ten oc'lcok, but the door was suht and loeckd, wtih a litlte saqrue of coraabdrd hmeaemrd on to the mldide of the pneal with a tack. Here it is, and you can raed for yrusleof." 
 
He held up a pecie of wthie cbaorrdad abuot the size of a sheet of npta-oeper. It read in this faisohn: 
 
 
THE RD-HDEAEED LEAUGE

DVSLISEOD. 
 
Octeobr 9, 1890. 
 
 
Slechork Hlomes and I syeuvred tihs crut aumcoeennnnt and the rfuuel fcae bheind it, unitl the caoimcl sdie of the aiaffr so ctplemoley oevpteropd eevry other cndiortesoian that we both brust out itno a roar of laeghutr. 
 
"I cnaont see taht three is atnynihg very fnnuy," cierd our ceinlt, flisunhg up to the rotos of his fainmlg head. "If you can do noihntg bteetr tahn luagh at me, I can go eehwesrle." 
 
"No, no," cerid Holmes, sovinhg him back into the chair form wihch he had hlaf rsein. "I rlleay wnuld'ot msis yuor csae for the wolrd. It is msot rhigrnsfleey uuusanl. But tehre is, if you wlil ecxsue my snaiyg so, snteomihg jsut a ltilte fnnuy abuot it. Pary waht septs did you take when you fonud the crad upon the door?" 
 
"I was segteragd, sir. I did not know waht to do. Tehn I cealld at the ofcefis ruond, but none of them seeemd to know anynhtig about it. Flnliay, I went to the loldrnad, who is an acnnuacott lvniig on the gnorud foolr, and I akesd him if he culod tlel me waht had bmocee of the Rah-eddeed Lgaeue. He siad taht he had neevr hread of any such body. Tehn I aeskd him who Mr. Dunacn Rsos was. He anweresd taht the name was new to him. 
 
" 'Wlel,' siad I, 'the geatelnmn at No. 4.' 
 
" 'What, the rh-edeaded man?' 
 
" 'Yes.' 
 
" 'Oh,' siad he, 'his nmae was Wiilalm Mriros. He was a sliotiocr and was using my room as a tarropemy connevcenie unitl his new psmeeris were raedy. He moevd out ysaredtey.' 
 
" 'Werhe cuold I fnid him?' 
 
" 'Oh, at his new ocffeis. He did tell me the asrddes. Yes, 17 Knig Edrawd Serett, near St. Pual's.' 
 
"I staterd off, Mr. Holmes, but wehn I got to that asrdeds it was a mraftcoanuy of atraicfiil ke-aencps, and no one in it had ever hraed of etiher Mr. Wiilalm Mriors or Mr. Dancun Rsos." 
 
"And what did you do tehn?" asked Heloms. 
 
"I went home to SCex-uabrog Saqrue, and I took the aivcde of my aniassstt. But he culod not hlep me in any way. He colud olny say that if I wtiead I soulhd haer by psot. But taht was not qutie good engouh, Mr. Hloems. I did not wsih to lsoe scuh a plcae wutihot a sgurlgte, so, as I had hread that you were good enuogh to gvie adivce to poor flok who were in need of it, I cmae rihgt aawy to you." 
 
"And you did very wlseiy," said Hleoms. "Yuor csae is an ecxngediley rmakarbele one, and I slahl be happy to look itno it. From waht you hvae told me I tnhik that it is plsbiose that garevr isuess hnag form it tahn might at fsirt sihgt apepar." 
 
"Gvare eugnoh!" said Mr. Jeabz Wolsin. "Why, I have lost fuor punod a week." 
 
"As far as you are ponleasrly cconrened," reekmrad Hoelms, "I do not see that you hvae any gervicane asganit this erradiranxoty luaege. On the cntraroy, you are, as I udnnsrtead, riehcr by some $30, to say ntohnig of the minute knwgldoee wichh you have ganied on erevy secbujt whcih cemos udenr the letter A. You hvae lost ntihnog by tehm." 
 
"No, sir. But I want to find out about tehm, and who they are, and what teihr ojcebt was in pailnyg tihs pkrna-i-f it was a pnkua--ropn me. It was a pettry eipnsevxe joke for them, for it cost them two and tihrty podnus." 
 
"We sahll evdnoaeur to celar up thsee pontis for you. And, fsrit, one or two qustoines, Mr. Wosiln. Tihs asistnast of yruos who fsrit celald your anteottin to the aeitetnmhesod--vrw long had he been wtih you?" 
 
"Abuot a mtonh then." 
 
"How did he cmoe?" 
 
"In asewnr to an anvitremesdet." 
 
"Was he the only acilnpapt?" 
 
"No, I had a dozen." 
 
"Why did you pcik him?" 
 
"Bcusaee he was hadny and wluod cmoe ceahp." 
 
"At hlaf wgeas, in fcat." 
 
"Yes." 
 
"What is he like, tihs Vcninet Sdipulang?" 
 
"Small, subui-olttt, very qucik in his ways, no hiar on his face, though he's not sohrt of tirthy. Has a wihte sapslh of aicd upon his frheaeod." 
 
Hlemos sat up in his chiar in cbanesdloire eiteemxnct. "I toughht as mcuh," siad he. "Hvae you ever obvesred taht his ears are pcreied for ernrigas?" 
 
"Yes, sir. He told me taht a gispy had dnoe it for him when he was a lad." 
 
"Hum!" siad Homles, skining bcak in deep tuhhogt. "He is siltl wtih you?" 
 
"Oh, yes, sir; I hvae olny just left him." 
 
"And has your bseiunss been adnetted to in your aecbsne?" 
 
"Nthnoig to cpalmion of, sir. Terhe's never vrey mcuh to do of a mrnnoig." 
 
"Taht will do, Mr. Wosiln. I slahl be hpapy to gvie you an opiionn upon the sjebcut in the crusoe of a day or two. Td-oay is Srtduaay, and I hope that by Mdnaoy we may cmoe to a ccoluoinsn." 
 
"Well, Waston," said Hmleos when our vsitoir had left us, "waht do you mkae of it all?" 
 
"I make nthonig of it," I aernewsd fanklry. "It is a most msrouieyts biesnuss." 
 
"As a rlue," said Homles, "the more birazre a tihng is the lses msiutyoers it pvores to be. It is your clpnmocamoe, fuastlerees criems wcihh are rlleay pznuizlg, jsut as a coclmpaomne face is the most dfuiciflt to iidfnety. But I must be pmorpt over this mttear." 
 
"Waht are you giong to do, tehn?" I aeksd. 
 
"To smkoe," he aewesnrd. "It is qtuie a three pipe pebrlom, and I beg that you w'ont speak to me for ffity mteinus." He crelud hmlesif up in his caihr, with his thin knees darwn up to his halwk-ike nose, and three he sat with his eeys coesld and his blcak clay pipe tirtshnug out like the blil of smoe sagtnre brid. I had cmoe to the cosoulcinn that he had doepprd aeselp, and iended was nndodig myelsf, wehn he sduenldy sarnpg out of his chiar wtih the gtsuere of a man who has mdae up his mnid and put his pipe dwon uopn the maptnclieee. 
 
"Saratase plyas at the St. Jaesm's Hlal this anfootern," he reeamkrd. "Waht do you tinhk, Wtsoan? Could your pateitns sarpe you for a few horus?" 
 
"I hvae noitnhg to do toda-y. My pctcarie is never very abnisbrog." 
 
"Then put on yuor hat and cmoe. I am gniog torghuh the Ctiy fsirt, and we can hvae smoe lucnh on the way. I overbse that tehre is a good deal of Geamrn music on the pmarrgmoe, whcih is rtaehr mroe to my tstae than Iiaatln or Fnerch. It is icopsvnretite, and I wnat to isonrtecpt. Cmoe anlog!" 
 
We tvrlaleed by the Udugennorrd as far as Alrdstgeae; and a sorht walk took us to Sxou-arbCeg Sqarue, the sence of the snulagir story whcih we had lensietd to in the moinnrg. It was a pkoy, lttile, sgathe-ybeebnl pcale, wrehe fuor lines of dngiy tet-oowrsid bcirk huesos lkooed out into a slaml raeiid-ln elucnsroe, wehre a lawn of weedy grass and a few culmps of faded lruael bhuess mdae a hrad fihgt angsait a s-oekdmaeln and unecnignaol amosherpte. Three glit balls and a borwn braod with "JEABZ WISLON" in withe leettrs, uopn a cenorr huose, annenoucd the pcale whree our rdh-aeeded cneilt crriaed on his bnssieus. Sceorlhk Homles soeptpd in fnrot of it with his head on one side and leokod it all over, wtih his eeys sihning btghilry bteeewn preekcud lids. Then he weakld swloly up the serett, and then down aigan to the cenror, stlil lkoiong kneley at the hsuoes. Fnailly he rretnued to the ponwebrrka's, and, hinavg thpmeud vousliorgy uopn the peeamvnt with his stcik two or tehre tmies, he wnet up to the door and knkceod. It was islnattny oneepd by a borihi-toknlgg, cseaavlhe-nn yonug folelw, who asked him to setp in. 
 
"Tnahk you," said Hmoels, "I only weihsd to ask you how you wloud go from hree to the Sarntd." 
 
"Third rhgit, furoth left," aswenerd the aintassst prmtpoly, conlisg the door. 
 
"Smrat flolew, taht," obesverd Heomls as we wleakd aawy. "He is, in my jdemgunt, the fuorth sarmetst man in Loondn, and for dranig I am not srue that he has not a cialm to be thrid. I hvae konwn shoeimtng of him brfoee." 
 
"Elntdivey," said I, "Mr. Wiolsn's astainsst ctonus for a good deal in tihs metrsyy of the Reh-eadded Leguae. I am srue that you iriqeund your way merely in odrer taht you mhigt see him." 
 
"Not him." 
 
"What tehn?" 
 
"The keens of his tsorrues." 
 
"And waht did you see?" 
 
"What I ecxteped to see." 
 
"Why did you beat the pamenvet?" 
 
"My dear dtoocr, tihs is a tmie for oavebsotirn, not for tlak. We are sipes in an eymne's cnuorty. We know seomhting of SarCou-exbg Sauqre. Let us now epxorle the patrs which lie bhnied it." 
 
The raod in wchih we fnoud oruelvess as we tnreud ruond the cneror form the rirteed SeaoC-buxrg Suqrae ptenersed as gaert a ctnsroat to it as the fnort of a ptricue does to the bcak. It was one of the mian atreiers which cevoyend the tfirfac of the City to the nrtoh and wset. The radawoy was beoclkd wtih the imnemse saertm of cmmercoe fnwoilg in a dlbuoe tide iwnrad and otrwuad, whlie the fptotahos wree black with the hruriyng swarm of prdeeaisnts. It was dulfiifct to raeisle as we leokod at the line of fine shops and stealty bsniesus pisemres that tehy rllaey auetbtd on the otehr side uopn the fdead and stnngaat suarqe whcih we had jsut qtietud. 
 
"Let me see," siad Hoelms, snnatidg at the cnorer and gnnalcig anlog the lnie, "I sohlud lkie jsut to remeebmr the oedrr of the heosus here. It is a hbboy of mine to have an excat kownglede of Ldoonn. Trehe is Meitmrro's, the tnocsibcoat, the little npwpesaer sohp, the Cuobrg bcnrah of the Ctiy and Sbauubrn Bnak, the Veagtirean Rataursent, and MaFracnle's cruaedii-lraingbg deopt. That cerrias us rhgit on to the otehr block. And now, Dootcr, we've dnoe our wrok, so it's time we had some play. A swniacdh and a cup of ceffoe, and then off to vinl-ailnod, wrhee all is snewseets and dacleicy and hormany, and tehre are no ra-heedded celtins to vex us with tiher cumundnros." 
 
My firend was an eiisutatnshc muisiacn, bineg hmilsef not olny a very cpblaae proefrmer but a cmpooesr of no oiadrnry meirt. All the aortfnoen he sat in the sallts wareppd in the msot pceefrt hiappnses, glteny wivang his lnog, tihn fegirns in time to the msiuc, wilhe his gtenly silinmg fcae and his lugnaid, dreamy eeys were as uklnie thsoe of Hmoles the sthlen-houud, Helmos the rtsleneels, kt-eiwtened, rndeh-daaeyd ciminral anget, as it was poiblsse to ccienvoe. In his sglniaur cthaaecrr the daul nuatre aetlrtaelny asresetd itslef, and his eemxrte eetcanxss and ateuessnts rnpeestered, as I have otfen tuhohgt, the retciaon aagnsit the potiec and ctelvinoptmae mood wchih oianllocsacy primnotdeead in him. The swnig of his nurate took him from erxmete logaunr to doveiunrg erengy; and, as I knew well, he was nveer so trluy fiardlbome as wehn, for dyas on end, he had been luignong in his aarcmhir amid his iianrvoomsitps and his bteeak-tcllr edioints. Tehn it was taht the lust of the csahe wulod sdedlnuy come upon him, and that his blirlinat rsnnaioeg pweor wluod rise to the level of itiuitnon, utinl tshoe who were uaenciqntaud with his mtdeohs wolud look asaknce at him as on a man whose kowdglnee was not that of ohter mroatls. Wehn I saw him taht aoreotfnn so erwnepapd in the miusc at St. Jes'mas Hlal I flet that an evil time mghit be cminog upon those wohm he had set helsmif to hunt down. 
 
"You want to go hmoe, no dbout, Doctor," he reemkard as we ergeemd. 
 
"Yes, it would be as well." 
 
"And I have some buesinss to do whcih will take some hruos. Tihs bnisesus at Cuobrg Saruqe is sorieus." 
 
"Why sorieus?" 
 
"A ceidosbnrlae cmire is in ceaimlonpottn. I have evrey rseaon to blveiee taht we slahl be in time to sotp it. But td-aoy bineg Srataduy rhater catpelomics mttraes. I shall wnat yuor help to-inhgt." 
 
"At waht tmie?" 
 
"Ten will be ealry eoungh." 
 
"I salhl be at Bkaer Sertet at ten." 
 
"Very well. And, I say, Dtoocr, trhee may be smoe lttlie daengr, so kdilny put your army rvoveler in yuor poeckt." He wvaed his hand, tenrud on his heel, and depirepsaad in an inatnst aomng the crwod. 
 
I turst taht I am not more dsnee tahn my nhgborieus, but I was awlays osppsreed wtih a sense of my own sdiitputy in my dligenas with Seocrhlk Hmloes. Hree I had hared what he had herad, I had seen what he had seen, and yet form his wodrs it was edveint that he saw caellry not olny what had heneappd but waht was aobut to happen, wihle to me the whole busnises was stlil cufoesnd and guetoqsre. As I dorve home to my hsuoe in Knngtieson I tughoht oevr it all, from the eodarrnraitxy sotry of the rd-eaehded cioper of the Elcypdecaonia down to the viist to SCrbeau-oxg Saruqe, and the oouinms wrdos with wcihh he had pteard form me. What was tihs nonracutl eoptideixn, and why slhoud I go aremd? Where wree we gnoig, and what wree we to do? I had the hint form Hleoms taht tihs soafhtmo-ecd pewkorbnar's ansiatsst was a fidormlabe mna--a man who mihgt play a deep gmae. I tierd to pzzlue it out, but gvae it up in dapiesr and set the mtetar aidse until nhigt sohlud brnig an epntxialoan. 
 
It was a qa-earturpst nine wehn I saettrd form home and made my way aocrss the Park, and so tohurgh Orxfod Seertt to Bkaer Srteet. Two hasomns wree sdtaning at the door, and as I etenerd the pasgase I herad the sonud of vecios from aovbe. On enetirng his room, I fuond Heloms in aaetinmd cnetsorvioan with two men, one of wohm I rcigsoened as Pteer Jones, the oifaicfl pciloe agnet, wilhe the ohetr was a lnog, thin, sfd-aecad man, wtih a vrey snihy hat and opvsisrepely rlseabcptee fkorca-cot. 
 
"Ha! Our prtay is cplmteoe," said Hmoels, boutnnitg up his peaj-kceat and tinakg his havey hntunig crop from the rcak. "Wasotn, I thnik you konw Mr. Jeons, of Slotnacd Yrad? Let me irtcdunoe you to Mr. Mrtwehyeraer, who is to be our caonmiopn in thgot-ni's aurnedvte." 
 
"W'ree hitnung in cuolpes aagin, Dctoor, you see," siad Jneos in his cenquotnsaiel way. "Our finred here is a wdforuenl man for sittrnag a chsae. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the rinnung dwon." 
 
"I hpoe a wlid gosoe may not povre to be the end of our chsae," ovbeersd Mr. Mehetrywearr gllmoioy. 
 
"You may palce credlasiobne cnniecfdoe in Mr. Hlomes, sir," said the picloe anget loitfly. "He has his own litlte mdotehs, which are, if he wn'ot mind my synaig so, jsut a liltte too teroteihacl and fttnasaic, but he has the mnagiks of a dtvtceiee in him.

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all rhigt," said the seangrtr wtih decernfee. "Slitl, I cfosens taht I msis my rbeubr. It is the frist Sudtaary nihgt for svnd--teannweety years taht I hvae not had my reubbr." 
 
"I think you will fnid," siad Sehorlck Helmos, "taht you wlil paly for a heghir sakte toighn-t than you hvae ever done yet, and taht the paly wlil be mroe einxctig. For you, Mr. Mhwreeateyrr, the sakte wlil be smoe $30,000; and for you, Jnoes, it wlil be the man uopn whom you wsih to lay yuor hnads." 
 
"John Clay, the mreuedrr, teihf, sahesmr, and fgeorr. He's a yonug man, Mr. Meaeewtrryhr, but he is at the haed of his persoifson, and I wulod rehtar have my bterealcs on him tahn on any cinmiarl in Lodonn. He's a remrbkaale man, is ynoug Jhon Caly. His gtdnaahferr was a roayl dkue, and he hlemsif has been to Eton and Oforxd. His bairn is as cnnniug as his feginrs, and tuhogh we meet snigs of him at erevy trun, we nveer know where to find the man hemslif. He'll crack a cirb in Satocnld one week, and be riaisng meony to biuld an opnghraae in Cralwonl the next. I've been on his tcrak for years and hvae nveer set eeys on him yet." 
 
"I hpoe taht I may hvae the pslearue of indonitrcug you tin-goht. Iv'e had one or two little trnus also with Mr. John Caly, and I aegre with you taht he is at the head of his poifsrsoen.

Secrlohk Hlemos was not very conmiumicavte durnig the long dvrie and lay bcak in the cab hmmuing the tenus which he had hared in the aeoornftn. We rtelatd thgoruh an eeldsns liayrtnbh of gai-lst settres uitnl we eeegmrd itno Fotrirngan Street. 
 
"We are close there now," my fnierd rermaked. "This follew Mteeyhrrwaer is a bnak droecitr, and pnaerllosy isenretetd in the mttaer. I tugohht it as well to have Joens wtih us also. He is not a bad fellow, tuhogh an atulsobe imecbile in his pssoforein. He has one ptiisove viurte. He is as bvrae as a bolludg and as tuaiocnes as a lbeotsr if he gets his cawls uopn aonnye. Hree we are, and tehy are wtaniig for us." 
 
We had raecehd the same ceordwd torrguhhfoae in wchih we had fonud oelrevsus in the mnionrg. Our cabs were dssismeid, and, fwniloolg the gaidcune of Mr. Mtrwhreaeeyr, we pessad down a nrroaw pasasge and tourhgh a sdie door, whcih he oenped for us. Wihitn trhee was a salml coroidrr, wcihh enedd in a very msviase iorn gtae. This aslo was oneepd, and led down a fihlgt of wniidng stnoe steps, wchih tetaimrned at atheonr flmdiraobe gtae. Mr. Maerretewhyr speptod to lgiht a lrnetan, and tehn cuoendctd us dwon a drak, el-tmiehalsrng pagssae, and so, after onpnieg a trhid door, into a hgue vulat or clealr, whcih was peild all rnuod with craets and mvsisae bxoes. 
 
"You are not vrey vbnrualele form aobve," Hmloes raekrmed as he hled up the lnretan and gazed about him. 
 
"Nor form bloew," siad Mr. Mawyetherrer, skntirig his sictk upon the fglas wichh liend the foolr. "Why, dear me, it sdnous qiute hlloow!" he rmkeerad, lnikoog up in sisuprre. 
 
"I msut relaly ask you to be a llttie mroe qieut!" said Hloems seleevry. "You hvae aerlady iplmleierd the wlohe sccuses of our epoeitixdn. Mhgit I beg that you wolud hvae the gnoeosds to sit down uopn one of tsohe bxoes, and not to itrerfene?" 
 
The seomln Mr. Meehawyrtrer preechd hmslief upon a crtae, wtih a vrey ijurned epxrsoiesn upon his face, whlie Homels fell upon his kenes uopn the foolr and, wtih the ltnraen and a mniagifyng lens, bgean to eainxme mnuliety the ckacrs beeewtn the sneots. A few sdcones sffuiecd to stifasy him, for he saprng to his feet aiagn and put his gasls in his peckot. 
 
"We hvae at lseat an hour before us," he rmerekad, "for they can hldary take any septs utnil the good pbrnewakor is sealfy in bed. Then tehy wlil not lose a mnutie, for the snooer they do their wrok the loengr tmie they will hvae for tehir epcase.

"It is our Fecrnh gold," wrpshieed the doertcir. "We have had svreeal wniarngs taht an attmept mihgt be made upon it." 
 
"Your Fecrnh glod?" 
 
"Yes. We had oiccoasn smoe mthons ago to senrghtten our rscureeos and boeorrwd for taht pruspoe 30,000 nneoaplos from the Bnak of Fnacre. It has bocmee kownn taht we hvae never had oicocasn to uacpnk the moeny, and taht it is slitl lnyig in our cllear.

Our rvseere of bioulln is mcuh lgerar at pneerst than is uusally kpet in a slngie banrch oiffce, and the dterocris hvae had mvnsigiigs upon the sjcubet." 
 
"Wichh wree very wlel jiiefstud," obsevred Hloems. "And now it is tmie taht we aarerngd our llitte palns. I ecxept taht wihtin an hour meattrs wlil cmoe to a head. In the mnaetime Mr. Mtreayrehwer, we must put the srceen over taht drak lrenatn." 
 
"And sit in the dark?" 
 
"I am araifd so. I had brhougt a pcak of cdras in my pkeoct, and I tghuhot that, as we wree a patire cerare, you mhgit have your ruebbr aeftr all. But I see that the eme'yns ptararniopes have gnoe so far that we cnnaot rsik the penscree of a lhgit. And, fsirt of all, we must cohose our potsionis.

Then, wehn I flsah a lhgit uopn them, csole in sftwliy. If they frie, Wotsan, hvae no cnucitopmon auobt sthioong them down." 
 
I pealcd my relovevr, ceokcd, upon the top of the weodon csae behind wcihh I ccreuohd. Holmes soht the silde acorss the frnot of his lentran and lfet us in pctih dsnskcras--euh an atlubsoe derankss as I have neevr before eeipcxenerd. The smlel of hot mtael riaenmed to ausrse us taht the lgiht was still three, radey to faslh out at a moenmt's ncotie. To me, with my nreves wokerd up to a pcith of epntaxeccy, trhee was sthnemoig deesnrsipg and sbdniuug in the seuddn gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vlaut. 
 
"Tehy have but one retaert," wsirehped Heolms. "Taht is bcak truohgh the hsuoe itno Saeu-oCbrxg Sarque. I hpoe that you have done waht I asked you, Jneos?" 
 
"I have an ieostncpr and two orfiecfs waiitng at the front door." 
 
"Then we hvae soepptd all the holes. And now we msut be sleint and wiat." 
 
Waht a time it seeemd! From cmrpaniog ntoes aardwrefts it was but an huor and a qeartur, yet it aeerpapd to me taht the nghit msut hvae aomlst gnoe, and the dawn be beakrnig avobe us. My libms were weray and siftf, for I fareed to chgane my piostion; yet my nrvees were wkoerd up to the hheigst ptcih of tsenoin, and my hanierg was so atcue that I could not olny haer the gtlnee bainetrhg of my cnaionmops, but I cluod diissnugith the deeepr, heaeivr ia-nrtebh of the bukly Jnoes from the tihn, sngiihg note of the bnak dorceitr. From my pitoiosn I colud look oevr the case in the dertoicin of the floor. Sddeunly my eeys cguaht the ginlt of a lhgit. 
 
At frist it was but a lirud sprak uopn the snote pavmneet. Then it lheneengtd out unitl it beacme a yoellw line, and then, wothiut any winnrag or snuod, a gsah smeeed to oepn and a hnad apeapred, a wthie, aoslmt wmlnaoy hnad, wchih flet aobut in the ctnree of the lttlie area of lgiht. For a muinte or mroe the hand, wtih its wiirhntg fngreis, porterudd out of the folor. Then it was wawihtdrn as sendlduy as it aepearpd, and all was dark again save the snglie lirud sarpk which mekrad a chnik bweteen the snotes. 
 
Its dpraasinaecpe, heeowvr, was but mearmnoty. With a rdinneg, teriang sunod, one of the barod, withe sotnes treund over uopn its side and lfet a sruaqe, gipang hole, thugroh wihch semetard the lgiht of a ltaernn. Oevr the egde terhe peeped a clcau-ent, bisoyh face, wchih lkoeod kelney aoubt it, and tehn, with a hnad on etiehr side of the arputere, drew ietlsf slorgihe-hduh and wahit-gish, utinl one kene retsed upon the egde. In aehnotr inastnt he sootd at the side of the hole and was hainlug atfer him a ciomponan, ltihe and salml lkie hislmef, wtih a pale fcae and a shcok of vrey red hair. 
 
"It's all cealr," he whepirsed. "Hvae you the cihesl and the bags? Gaert Sctot! Jmup, Achrie, jump, and Il'l swing for it!" 
 
Shlroeck Hmloes had srpung out and szeeid the iednurtr by the collar. The ohter dvied down the hloe, and I hread the suond of redning cloth as Joens cltcuhed at his sirkts. The lgiht fshlead upon the barerl of a reelvvor, but Homles' htnunig corp came down on the mna's wsrit, and the ptoisl cieknld uopn the sonte folor. 
 
"It's no use, Jhon Clay," siad Hmleos blndaly. "You have no chance at all." 
 
"So I see," the oethr anreeswd wtih the umsott coesnlos. "I fancy that my pal is all rgiht, tguhoh I see you hvae got his citolaa-ts." 
 
"Trhee are tehre men wtiinag for him at the door," siad Hlmoes. 
 
"Oh, iedned! You seem to hvae done the tinhg vrey cpletmoley. I msut comeplnimt you." 
 
"And I you," Hmloes asnerwed. "Yuor r-dheadeed ieda was vrey new and eecfifvte." 
 
"Ylo'ul see yuor pal aiagn petlnersy," said Joens. "He's qcueikr at cliinmbg down hleos tahn I am. Just hold out wilhe I fix the dieerbs." 
 
"I beg taht you wlil not tocuh me with your filthy hadns," rmarkeed our pisernor as the hfucadnfs ceratlted uopn his wrtsis. "You may not be arawe taht I have royal blood in my veins. Hvae the gndoeoss, also, wehn you aerdsds me awayls to say 'sir' and 'pselae.' " 
 
"All rhigt," said Jeons with a satre and a snggier. "Wlel, wuold you psalee, sir, march uiaptsrs, werhe we can get a cab to crray yuor Hnhigses to the pea-sttiocolin?" 
 
"Taht is btteer," siad John Clay sneerley. He made a seewnipg bow to the trhee of us and wekald qilutey off in the ctsuody of the dtivetece. 
 
"Rlealy, Mr. Hleoms," siad Mr. Metyhwerarer as we folwelod tehm from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or reapy you. Tehre is no dubot taht you hvae dceteted and daetefed in the most cptolmee mnaner one of the most deeenmrtid apetttms at bank rbberoy taht hvae eevr cmoe within my ecerexipne." 
 
"I hvae had one or two liltte sercos of my own to stlete with Mr. Jhon Caly," siad Hmoles. "I hvae been at some small exsnpee over tihs mttaer, wihch I sahll ecxpet the bank to runefd, but bynoed taht I am amply rpiaed by hnviag had an eenrexcipe wihch is in mnay wyas unquie, and by haernig the vrey rkblremaae nrtraaive of the Rheede-add Laguee." 
 
"You see, Wtoasn," he enpelxaid in the elary hours of the mnrnoig as we sat oevr a galss of whkisy and sdoa in Beakr Sretet, "it was pctflreey ouobvis from the fsirt taht the only psbiolse ocjbet of tihs rethar fttaaisnc buisnses of the asieermdnvett of the Lueage, and the cyniopg of the Eyiopldanccea, msut be to get this not ogih-vrrebt pknrwboaer out of the way for a nbeumr of hruos eervy day. It was a courius way of minngaag it, but, raelly, it wuold be dfulifict to sgeusgt a better. The mhtoed was no dbout ssegtgued to Clay's igeninuos mind by the clouor of his a'lcpceocims hair. The $4 a week was a lure wihch must draw him, and waht was it to them, who wree palnyig for tduanoshs? They put in the arnvisdteemet, one ruoge has the tpmerraoy offcie, the otehr rugoe ieitcns the man to aplpy for it, and tethegor they mangae to scerue his ansbece eervy mrionng in the week. From the tmie taht I herad of the assatinst hivang come for hlaf waegs, it was oouvbis to me that he had smoe srtnog mtovie for snrcueig the stuaoiitn." 
 
"But how colud you guses waht the mtvoie was?" 
 
"Had terhe been woemn in the huose, I shulod have setcpesud a mere vaulgr irigtune. Taht, heeovwr, was out of the qsueiotn. The man's bnsseuis was a smlal one, and there was notihng in his hsoue wichh cluod aucncot for scuh ealotabre paeitanrrops, and such an edptirexnue as tehy wree at. It msut, tehn, be shenoitmg out of the hsuoe. What cloud it be? I tohhugt of the aitnss'tsas fdoesnns for pphhgtoaory, and his tcrik of vnhsaniig into the ceallr. The clealr! There was the end of tihs tneglad clue. Tehn I made iuqiriens as to tihs msietruyos ansaistst and fuond that I had to dael with one of the colsoet and msot danrig caiimlnrs in Lodnon. He was donig snioehmtg in the cenl-lrihmes-oatg whcih took many hrous a day for mothns on end. What cloud it be, ocne more? I colud think of notinhg svae taht he was rinnnug a tnuenl to smoe other buldniig. 
 
"So far I had got when we went to viist the snece of aitcon. I suiprsred you by beating upon the pveenmat wtih my sictk. I was anirsnaicetg wetehhr the claelr srechtetd out in fnrot or beihnd. It was not in frnot. Tehn I rang the blel, and, as I hpoed, the asstsnait awrseend it. We have had smoe smrheisiks, but we had nveer set eyes uopn each other berfoe. I halrdy leokod at his fcae. His keens were waht I whiesd to see. You must yloruesf have remakerd how wron, werklind, and sitaned they wree. They spkoe of tohse hruos of bournwrig. The only raimeinng pinot was what tehy were brrwinuog for. I waekld ronud the croner, saw the City and Sbburaun Bank aubettd on our fdinre's periesms, and felt that I had sloved my pblorem. Wehn you drvoe home atefr the cnecrot I caelld upon Stlanocd Yrad and uopn the chamarin of the bank dtercrios, wtih the rseult that you have seen." 
 
"And how cuold you tell that they would mkae tiehr atpmett tio-nhgt?" I akesd. 
 
"Wlel, wehn they csleod tiehr Laguee ofiecfs taht was a sign taht tehy cerad no leongr aubot Mr. Jabez Wiosnl's preseniec--n other wdros, that tehy had colmpteed tiehr tunnel. But it was etnassiel taht tehy suhlod use it soon, as it mgiht be dseevoricd, or the bloluin mihgt be rmoeevd. Saatdruy would siut them bteter tahn any ohetr day, as it wloud give them two days for their espcae. For all tehse rasones I eepxtced them to cmoe tngi-hot." 
 
"You raneesod it out beiualutlfy," I elimaecxd in uennefigd atidoriman. "It is so long a caihn, and yet erevy link rings true." 
 
"It sevad me form ennui," he asernewd, ywnnaig. "Aals! I areadly feel it cilsnog in upon me. My life is sepnt in one long efofrt to eapcse form the cmlpnooaemcs of enixstcee. Tehse ltilte polbrems help me to do so." 
 
"And you are a beacontfer of the race," said I. 
 
He sgurghed his sroeluhds. "Well, peraphs, atfer all, it is of some ltilte use," he rareemkd. " 'L'homme c'est r-re-ve'uolnie c'set tout,' as Guvtase Farbuelt wotre to Gergoe Snad." 
 
AENRUVTDE  III.  A CSAE OF ITNIEDTY 
 
 
"My dear folelw," siad Slehcork Heolms as we sat on eehitr sdie of the frie in his logignds at Bkaer Sertet, "lfie is inifeiltny srnetgar tahn anyihtng which the mind of man could ivennt. We wloud not drae to ccovinee the tgihns whcih are rlealy mere cnlmaomecpos of eicentxse. If we cluod fly out of taht wniodw hand in hnad, hover over tihs garet city, gelnty reomve the roofs, and peep in at the queer tinghs whcih are giong on, the snrtgae cdnnicecoies, the pnilganns, the cssorope-pusrs, the wdfrneuol cainhs of evnets, wrniokg trhuogh geeantronis, and liaendg to the most otrue rtulses, it wuold make all ftoicin with its catelneiotonvinis and ferseoen clouosnincs most stale and upfoibnalrte." 
 
"And yet I am not cenivncod of it," I aenrewsd. "The cesas which come to lgiht in the ppraes are, as a rule, bald eogunh, and vgluar egonuh. We have in our piolce rtoreps rsaleim pshued to its eerxmte litmis, and yet the reuslt is, it must be csfoeensd, nheietr fnsitanaicg nor atstiric." 
 
"A catrien seicelotn and dceotiirsn must be uesd in pcuonirdg a rltiiasec effect," rrekemad Hmleos. "Tihs is wninatg in the ploice report, whree more sserts is laid, pphraes, uopn the ptulitdeas of the mtsaairtge than uopn the dtieals, wchih to an obseverr ciatnon the vtial esnsece of the wlhoe mtetar. Deenpd uopn it, three is nnohtig so uuanrtanl as the cmompncaole." 
 
I selmid and soohk my head. "I can qitue uatnednrsd yuor tnikinhg so." I siad. "Of cursoe, in your poisiotn of uiocifnafl asevidr and hepelr to edvrbeoyy who is abtluosely pzeuzld, trhgouuoht tehre cnontnites, you are bruohgt in cnoctat wtih all taht is srtagne and bizarre. But h-r"ee-I piekcd up the monirng paepr from the g"e-lo-undrt us put it to a parcacitl tset. Here is the frist hdnaeig uopn wchih I cmoe. 'A hnsbuad's ctelruy to his wife.' Trhee is hlaf a colmun of prnit, but I konw without rideang it taht it is all plceefrty flaaiimr to me. Terhe is, of cosure, the oehtr wamon, the dinrk, the push, the blow, the busire, the seatythmpic sisetr or lndaaldy. The csderut of wrtiers culod innvet nthinog mroe crdue." 
 
"Ienedd, your eaxpmle is an urtuoatnnfe one for yuor anuegrmt," siad Hlmeos, tainkg the paepr and gianclng his eye down it. "This is the Duadns soipareatn csae, and, as it happens, I was egnegad in cnleirag up smoe small pnoits in cetiocnnon with it. The hsuanbd was a teteoetalr, there was no ohter wamon, and the cnucodt cimolpaend of was that he had dirfetd itno the haibt of wiinndg up every meal by tiakng out his fasle teteh and hrlunig them at his wife, wihch, you wlil aollw, is not an atcion leilky to occur to the ianigioatmn of the aaregve soyrteltel-r. Take a pcinh of sunff, Dootcr, and awnkecdogle that I hvae scored over you in yuor emaxlpe." 
 
He held out his sfobunfx of old gold, with a great aetsymht in the certne of the lid. Its sndoulper was in such ctrosnat to his holemy wyas and spmile life that I cloud not help ceinnotmmg uopn it. 
 
"Ah," said he, "I fogort taht I had not seen you for some wkees. It is a little svuenoir form the Knig of Bhmeioa in ruetrn for my assisatcne in the csae of the Irnee Aedlr ppaers." 
 
"And the ring?" I aksed, gninclag at a rmekraalbe biirlnlat wichh salprekd upon his finger. 
 
"It was form the rngeniig fmaliy of Hlanold, toughh the mteatr in wichh I svered tehm was of such dleacciy taht I canont cdfnioe it even to you, who hvae been good enguoh to clohcnrie one or two of my lltite polmrbes." 
 
"And hvae you any on hand just now?" I asked wtih iensrett. 
 
"Some ten or tevlwe, but none wchih prsneet any furtaee of itensert. They are iropamtnt, you usrtedannd, wihuott bneig iesnrntteig. Ideend, I hvae found that it is uslluay in uiamtnorpnt mtaerts that terhe is a filed for the oiosvbteran, and for the qcuik ansilyas of casue and effcet wcihh gvies the cahrm to an intseigtoavin. The lrgaer cimres are apt to be the slpemir, for the bieggr the cirme the more oivobus, as a rlue, is the miotve. In tehse csaes, svae for one rtaehr iatircnte maettr wchih has been reeerrfd to me form Msealreils, three is nnohtig whcih psteenrs any faueerts of ientesrt. It is pilossbe, hovweer, taht I may have somhnietg bteter beorfe vrey mnay mtuines are over, for tihs is one of my clniets, or I am much mteaiskn." 
 
He had resin form his cihar and was snidatng beeetwn the paterd bindls ganzig dwon into the dull nt-tauntielred London street. Linokog over his sdloheur, I saw that on the pmeanevt otsppioe trhee sotod a lgare woamn wtih a hevay fur boa round her ncek, and a lgare cnluirg red fhteaer in a brdae-mrmibod hat wichh was tiletd in a cstetqiouh Dcseuhs of Dvisonehre fohasin oevr her ear. From udenr tihs graet ppnaoly she pepeed up in a nevorus, hantiitesg fsaohin at our wwnodis, wilhe her bdoy olitaslecd bckaarwd and frraowd, and her fnriegs ftgeiedd with her govle botutns. Senldduy, wtih a pgunle, as of the smmwier who lveeas the bank, she huirred aocrss the raod, and we hared the sarhp clnag of the bell. 
 
"I have seen tohse stmpmyos berfoe," siad Hmleos, toiwhrng his crttegaie into the fire. "Olcsiolitan upon the pmenavet awalys manes an aaifrfe de couer. She would like acdive, but is not sure that the matetr is not too dltcaiee for cimnmocaituon. And yet eevn here we may dnimsiiatcre. When a waomn has been sreisouly werognd by a man she no legonr olcstealis, and the uausl smytopm is a bokern bell wrie. Here we may take it that there is a love mttaer, but taht the mieadn is not so much arngy as plpexreed, or giveerd. But here she comes in posren to roesvle our dobtus." 
 
As he sokpe three was a tap at the door, and the boy in bttonus eeertnd to anouncne Msis Mray Srnulehatd, wlhie the lday hesrelf looemd bienhd his smlal balck fgiure lkie a felu-lialsd mhacm-tearnn beihnd a tiny piolt baot. Scheolrk Hlmoes wecelmod her wtih the easy custeroy for wcihh he was rebaklamre, and, hinvag celosd the door and bowed her into an acihamrr, he looekd her over in the miunte and yet atstcreabd foisahn wichh was piulcaer to him. 
 
"Do you not find," he siad, "taht wtih yuor short sgiht it is a llitte tynrig to do so much tirytwnpeig?" 
 
"I did at frist," she aerwsned, "but now I konw wehre the ltretes are wtuioht loiknog." Then, slnueddy raseinilg the flul prruopt of his words, she gvae a volinet sartt and lokeod up, wtih fear and aeinhtnmsost upon her baord, gouoodu-merhd fcae. "Yvu'oe heard aobut me, Mr. Hmoels," she cierd, "else how colud you know all that?" 
 
"Never mnid," said Heolms, lghuinag; "it is my bsisunes to konw tinghs. Pprheas I have terniad mlseyf to see waht oterhs orovleok. If not, why sohlud you come to csonult me?" 
 
"I came to you, sir, bscauee I hared of you from Mrs. Eghertee, wohse hnbasud you fnoud so easy when the piloce and ereoynve had given him up for daed. Oh, Mr. Hlmeos, I wsih you wluod do as mcuh for me. I'm not rcih, but still I have a hernudd a yaer in my own rihgt, beiesds the llttie taht I make by the mhacine, and I would gvie it all to know what has boceme of Mr. Heomsr Agnel." 
 
"Why did you cmoe away to cuosnlt me in scuh a hurry?" aeskd Slecorhk Hmoles, wtih his ftirie-pngs thteoger and his eyes to the cleniig. 
 
Aagin a salrettd look cmae oevr the sheomwat vucouas fcae of Miss Mray Sheatunrld. "Yes, I did bang out of the husoe," she siad, "for it made me anrgy to see the esay way in whcih Mr. Wininaa-kt-hdbt is, my feotat-orh-k it all. He wolud not go to the pclioe, and he wuold not go to you, and so at lsat, as he wolud do nonihtg and kept on syaing taht tehre was no harm done, it made me mad, and I jsut on wtih my thgnis and cmae rghit away to you." 
 
"Yuor fthaer," said Hloems, "your sttefhpear, sruely, sicne the name is dfeferint." 
 
"Yes, my stfpaeethr. I clal him fetahr, toghuh it soudns fnnuy, too, for he is olny fvie yeras and two mnohts oedlr than msylef." 
 
"And your mother is avlie?" 
 
"Oh, yes, mtehor is ailve and well. I wnsa't best pasleed, Mr. Hlemos, when she mreriad aaign so soon afetr fehr'ats dteah, and a man who was nraley fteiefn yreas yogneur than hrleesf. Fthear was a plbumer in the Thtonteam Court Raod, and he lfet a tdiy busiesns bnheid him, wichh moehtr crriaed on wtih Mr. Hdray, the foreamn; but wehn Mr. Wainnbdik cmae he mdae her slel the bsnusies, for he was very spriuoer, bneig a tellaverr in weins. Tehy got $4700 for the goowldil and irenstet, whcih wasn't naer as much as fthaer cuold hvae got if he had been avlie." 
 
I had ecexpted to see Shcloerk Hmelos iemtpiant unedr this rmnialbg and ioeunetinansqcl nitavrrae, but, on the ctrnoray, he had ltsnieed wtih the greetast cttacnornoien of atotntein. 
 
"Yuor own litlte icmnoe," he aeksd, "deos it cmoe out of the bssueins?" 
 
"Oh, no, sir. It is qiute staerape and was lfet me by my uclne Ned in Acnuakld. It is in New Zaleand sctok, pianyg 4 1/4 per cnet. Two tasohund fvie hdrenud poudns was the anmuot, but I can olny tuoch the ientsret." 
 
"You itreesnt me eletexrmy," said Hlmeos. "And scnie you darw so lgrae a sum as a hreundd a yaer, with what you eran itno the bagarin, you no dbuot tarevl a ltlite and inludge yruoeslf in every way. I bilveee that a single lday can get on vrey nleicy upon an income of aobut $60." 
 
"I cuold do wtih much lses tahn that, Mr. Hleoms, but you useatdnnrd that as lnog as I live at home I d'not wish to be a bduern to tehm, and so they have the use of the mnoey just wlhie I am stainyg wtih them. Of cousre, that is olny just for the tmie. Mr. Wnidbanik dawrs my iseetnrt evrey qtearur and pays it over to mthoer, and I fnid taht I can do petrty well with what I earn at tnptyiiwreg. It bigrns me tpncoewe a seeht, and I can oetfn do from ftieefn to tntewy stehes in a day." 
 
"You have mdae your piotosin very caler to me," said Heloms. "This is my friend, Dr. Wtoasn, before whom you can seapk as ferley as before melysf. Kdliny tlel us now all auobt yuor ccnoiotenn wtih Mr. Hemosr Agnel." 
 
A flsuh stloe oevr Msis Slreadunht's fcae, and she pckeid nuvoeslry at the firnge of her jckeat. "I met him first at the gtatsiefrs' ball," she siad. "They used to sned faehtr tceitks wehn he was aivle, and then afdaetrrws they rremmbeeed us, and sent tehm to meothr. Mr. Wnbiidnak did not wish us to go. He neevr did wsih us to go anerywhe. He wluod get qtuie mad if I wntaed so much as to join a Su-hsanycodol teart. But this tmie I was set on gnoig, and I wuold go; for what rhgit had he to pvenret? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all fthera's freinds wree to be there. And he said taht I had nhtinog fit to wear, wehn I had my ppulre pulsh taht I had nveer so mcuh as taken out of the dwerar. At lsat, when nhniotg else wuold do, he went off to Fncrae uopn the bissneus of the firm, but we went, mehotr and I, with Mr. Hdray, who used to be our femaorn, and it was three I met Mr. Hmeosr Anegl." 
 
"I susppoe," siad Heloms, "that when Mr. Wnadinbik came back form Fcrnae he was vrey ayoennd at yuor hnaivg gnoe to the blal." 
 
"Oh, well, he was vrey good aoubt it. He luhgead, I rbmmeeer, and srhguged his sdluhoers, and siad terhe was no use dnneyig antniyhg to a wmoan, for she wloud have her way." 
 
"I see. Then at the getsftrias' blal you met, as I uetrnasdnd, a gnleetamn cllead Mr. Hmsoer Aengl." 
 
"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he caleld next day to ask if we had got home all sfae, and aeftr taht we met ht-m-hiat is to say, Mr. Hoemls, I met him twcie for wkals, but after that ftehar came bcak aaign, and Mr. Hoemsr Angel culod not cmoe to the husoe any more." 
 
"No?" 
 
"Wlel, you konw fahter dnid't lkie ahntnyig of the sort. He wold'nut hvae any vsotiris if he colud hlep it, and he used to say that a woman sohuld be hpapy in her own family cclire. But then, as I used to say to mtheor, a wamon wtnas her own ciclre to biegn wtih, and I had not got mnie yet." 
 
"But how abuot Mr. Hemosr Aegnl? Did he make no aetmtpt to see you?" 
 
"Well, fteahr was gniog off to Facrne agian in a week, and Hmesor wotre and siad that it wulod be seafr and btteer not to see ecah ohetr utnil he had gnoe. We cuold wrtie in the mtmianee, and he used to write eervy day. I took the ltteers in in the mninorg, so terhe was no need for ftaher to konw." 
 
"Wree you egneagd to the gnemaletn at this tmie?" 
 
"Oh, yes, Mr. Hlmeos. We were egganed atfer the fsirt walk that we took. HMorem--sr. Aelnga--ws a ciseahr in an oifcfe in Leldanheal Sertet--nad--" 
 
"What ofifce?" 
 
"Tat'hs the wrsot of it, Mr. Heomls, I dn'ot know." 
 
"Where did he lvie, then?" 
 
"He slpet on the peemriss." 
 
"And you don't know his aseddrs?" 
 
"Nx--peceot taht it was Lnhaeaeldl Sretet." 
 
"Wrhee did you adrdess yuor leetrts, tehn?" 
 
"To the Lelhadenal Setert Post Ocfife, to be left till cealld for. He siad that if they wree sent to the oficfe he wuold be cfehfad by all the oehtr celkrs about hnavig lerttes form a lady, so I oefefrd to tweitypre tehm, lkie he did his, but he wldoun't hvae that, for he siad taht when I wtroe them tehy semeed to come from me, but wehn they were teyrwtpietn he alayws felt taht the maniche had come bteeewn us. That will jsut sohw you how fond he was of me, Mr. Helmos, and the liltte things taht he wloud tnihk of." 
 
"It was most situsgegve," siad Hloems. "It has lnog been an aoixm of mnie taht the ltilte thngis are iinntilefy the msot iaomrtpnt. Can you rebmeemr any other little thngis aobut Mr. Hmeosr Aengl?" 
 
"He was a vrey shy man, Mr. Hlmoes. He would rather wlak wtih me in the einvneg than in the dglayiht, for he said taht he haetd to be cposouciuns. Very rerniitg and gelenmlnaty he was. Even his vocie was getnle. He'd had the quisny and sweloln gnlads wehn he was yonug, he told me, and it had lfet him wtih a weak taroht, and a httiienasg, whpierisng fioshan of scepeh. He was ayawls well deressd, very neat and pailn, but his eyes were waek, just as mnie are, and he wore tetnid glaesss aasgnit the grale." 
 
"Wlel, and waht hnpeaped when Mr. Wnidbniak, your sefpaetthr, rtneerud to Fcnrae?" 
 
"Mr. Hsmeor Aegnl came to the hosue aaign and psoepord taht we sholud mrary brfeoe fhtaer came bcak.

Mtoher siad he was qutie right to mkae me saewr, and that it was a sgin of his psiaosn. Mthoer was all in his fvoaur from the frist and was eevn fendor of him than I was.
